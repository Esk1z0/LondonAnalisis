188,Huge double room is quiet Finsbury Park street,"£1,075 pcm","--- THE LOCATION ---Our house is in an excellent location - a quiet, leafy street with a direct entrance to both Finsbury Park and the Parkland Walk. Weâre also just off Stroud Green Road, which has tons of great bars, restaurants and shops nearby, as well as a Lidl, Tesco and Sainsburys. The best pub in London (in our humble opinion!) is the Faltering Fullback, right around the corner. Weâre a 10 minute walk to Finsbury Park station (Zone 2, Victoria & Piccadilly lines, National Rail) and 15 minutes to Crouch Hill (Overground). --- THE ROOM ---The available room is the master bedroom - an enormous room with two large windows that allow for plenty of natural light to come through. It comes fully furnished with a king size bed, 2 large wardrobes, a chest of drawers, and a desk. Iâve worked from home in this room for a couple of years now, so if thatâs your thing you definitely have the space to work comfortably. Thereâs also plenty of space for other creature comforts if you want them. Iâve got an armchair in the corner which has been a lovely little reading nook to enjoy through winter, and the previous tenant had an entire sofa and TV in here!--- THE HOUSE ---Our 4 bed, 2 bath home is huge! It takes up 3 floors of a gorgeous Victorian terraced house, and is honestly one of the biggest rentals Iâve seen! The kitchen is huge and comes with a dishwasher and washing machine. There are French doors leading from the kitchen to a balcony which is lovely to sit out on in the summer. We also have a large living room with two sofas that pull out as sofa beds, if ever you have friends to stay. We have broadband and fast internet. We know our downstairs neighbours and theyâre great. --- THE HOUSEMATES ---Youâd be living with Tash, Tara and Kat. Kat works for a digital design agency, Tara works in publishing, and Tash works for a refugee charity. We like watching the odd film together, grabbing a pizza or having a drink down the pub, and in recent months weâve become fans of bowling and arcade games at the infamous Rowans (10 mins away). We are all quite like-minded women, with strong feminist principles!Iâm the housemate who is moving out (Kate) because Iâve finally saved enough money to buy a flat - both exciting and terrifying! Iâve lived in this flat for 6 years, and absolutely love it - so Iâm gutted to be leaving! Whoever moves in will be so lucky to live with these 3 gals, who are not only incredibly kind and thoughtful housemates, but over the years of living together have become firm friends. --- OUR IDEAL HOUSEMATE ---Weâre looking for a young professional to join us, someone around the same age as us (28-35). Weâre not really a party house, but that doesnât mean we donât have a few drinks on the weekend or have friends over from time to time. We want the house to be homely rather than a place where everyone lives in their own rooms. So if that sounds like you, do get in touch!--- LOGISTICS ---Rent for the room is £1,075 per month, and bills are about £120 each month. We each take responsibility for 1 or 2 of the bills. The landlord is a private landlord. Move in date is negotiable.If youâre interested to view the room and think youâll be a good fit, please drop us an email with a bit about you and weâll arrange a time to visit!",Flat share,Finsbury Park,N4,https://www.spareroom.co.uk/flatshare/flatshare_detail.pl?flatshare_id=16674806&search_id=1212209861&city_id=&flatshare_type=offered&search_results=%2Fflatshare%2F%3Foffset%3D170%26search_id%3D1212209861%26sort_by%3Dby_day%26mode%3Dlist&,Now,None,None,Furnished,,,,Yes,,shared,Yes,No,No,No,Professional,,Female preferred,,28,35,Spareroom

We have a washing machine and a gas stove with electric oven. The area is beautiful with a lot of parks and open spaces for exercise and pass times.

235,Lovely double room in Crouch End,£540 pcm,"We have a good sized bright double room in a three bedroom flat in Crouch End available from 29 May 2023. Our current flat mate is moving back to Sweden after a year and a half in the flat.  THE ROOM: The room is a good sized double. It is furnished with the bed frame and wardrobe currently as our current flatmate brought a lot of her own furniture. Some of it may be possible to purchase. But our landlady has also been very flexible about furniture previously and so whether you wanted to bring your own or needed some new items to be purchased it would probably be okay. We  can discuss that and check with the landlady if you were interested in taking the room.  CURRENT FLATMATES: We are both professionals, in our early 30s. We are very friendly, quiet, considerate and clean. Laurie has lived here for just over 3 years, Michal has lived here for just over a year. Laurie is a solicitor and Michal works for a design studio.We keep things quite quiet and calm at home and so socialise mainly outside of the flat but do occasionally have friends/family to stay or round for dinner. We really like the flat and it is very much our home so we are looking for someone who is interested in making it theirs too!  ABOUT YOU:We are looking for a flatmate of a similar age who is mature, friendly, quiet, clean, kind, and considerate. We want the flat to remain a calm space where we can relax from a busy day and so someone with the same outlook and work pattern would be ideal. We both work most of the time at our respective office/studio and so ideally we are looking for someone who does not work at home all the time.We both eat mainly vegetarian food and try to live ecologically so someone with the same habits would be great though not essential at all.  ABOUT THE FLAT: The flat is a good sized, bright, three bed on the second (&top) floor of a small block. There is a spacious living room, separate kitchen and a bathroom. There is also a small balcony.We each have our own space in the fridge and allotted kitchen cupboard space. We share cleaning and general chores in the common areas (emptying bins, cleaning the floors, bathroom and kitchen etc once a week) on a loose rota and would expect the new tenant to pitch in with this.We like to keep the living room communal and so do not use it for working. There is off street parking just outside the flat which can be used if you apply for a permit which is free. THE AREA: Crouch End is a really nice place to live. It is quiet and leafy with a lovely variety of independent shops, cafes, pubs and restaurants as well as the usual supermarkets. Priory Park is a really nice local park very near to the flat and Alexandra Palace is a short walk away. Park Road Leisure Centre with a lido is almost opposite the flat and there is a Virgin gym in Crouch End. Crouch End also has 2 cinemas! The main transport from Crouch End is buses which go to Finsbury Park or Archway stations.  THE RENT: The rent per month is £540 which does not include any bills. The bills are split equally between the 3 of us and we split the responsibility. You would be responsible for the council tax. Our energy bill has gone up significantly due to the rise in prices so altogether at the moment bills come to approx £150-160 per month each. This includes gas and electric, water, council tax, tv license, wifi and paying for household items like cleaning products and toilet roll. This may go down over the summer when we use less energy. The landlady requires you to provide employment and tenancy references and the deposit is one monthâs rent which is secured with Mydeposits. Rent is paid monthly in advance. The tenancy agreement is for 6 months with the possibility of further extension. VIEWINGS: Ideally we would like viewings to take place in the evenings during the week. Please get in touch ASAP if you are interested and would like to arrange a viewing. We plan on doing viewings over the next two weeks. A message via SpareRoom would be preferred and we will get back to you as soon as possible.Thank you!!",Flat share,Crouch End,N8,https://www.spareroom.co.uk/flatshare/flatshare_detail.pl?flatshare_id=15896536&search_id=1212209861&city_id=&flatshare_type=offered&search_results=%2Fflatshare%2F%3Foffset%3D210%26search_id%3D1212209861%26sort_by%3Dby_day%26mode%3Dlist&,29 May 2023,10 months,None,Furnished,Yes,,,Yes,,shared,Yes,No,No,No,Don't mind,Yes,Female preferred,,25,40,Spareroom

244,Beautiful flat near viccy park,£975 pcm,"Sadly, Iâm leaving London and have to give up my spot in this lovely flat with my amazing flatmate. Iâm looking for someone special to fill the room in our 2 bedroom flat commencing 7th May.Weâve lived here since September 2020 and have loved every moment. Weâve enjoyed the very strong community vibe, the lazy strolls to Victoria Park and easy access to all the best spots the East has to offer. There are also 3 pubs and 3 bakeries on our street â life is good here.The apartment is filled with light, is spacious, has lots of storage and has an outdoor patio which is heavenly for getting some rays in before the day starts. The room available is on the top floor at the back of the apartment. Itâs quiet and offers pretty sunrises each morning. There are two built in floor-to-ceiling wardrobes, with room for double bed + bedside and mirror. Thereâs also a shelf for plants, books and bits â double glazed windows were recently installed too. Just outside the room, thereâs a space for large drawers for your exclusive use. Some furniture can be included for a one-off fee or you can bring your own. Living spaces are all shared and easy to keep tidy. Weâre a very clean flat. Looks better, feels better! Ideally, you are a hybrid or in-office worker to keep things balanced. If and when you work from home, the dining room table is a good shout, alternatively there are lots of cafes to work from too. The 425 and 277 towards Mile End tube depart at the bus stop out the front, the other direction will get you Hackney / Dalston way. The 377 toward Liverpool Street / London Bridge leaves just around the corner. The canal and Mare Street are about a 15 min walk, London Fields is around 20. Choose from The Hemmingway, Lauriston, Empress or Royal Inn as your new boozer. The big Tesco on Well St (right by The Gun) is about 15 min walk, or you can grab some lovely bits from the organic grocer just out front. Thereâs a Pure Gym a 10 min walk away or you can join in on some group fitness action in the park if thatâs your thing. A little about my lovely flatmate Katy. Sheâs Australian, 34, work in fashion and has lived in London for four character-building years. Sheâs  into the arts, good music, and dogs (she doesnât have one, but is partial to babysitting / waving at them from the window). She loves buying plants, afternoons at the pub and dyeing and experimenting with fabrics. Sheâs an active gal and likes to keep local on the weekends. She often travels for work, too. Iâm looking for someone who is of similar interests, is respectful of the space and likes to keep things both chilled and sacred whilst also being up for a pint and a laugh every so often. Pescatarian / vegetarian folks and a love of raising plants will earn extra points!The area itself is quite sleepy and we try to be respectful of one another. So no afters, sorry :) Long brunches, lunches and dinners are of course welcomed.The cost of the room is £975 paid directly to our very lovely landlord on the 1st of each month. Youâll take on 50% of the lease, bills are shared equally which is roughly £100 pp p/m (council tax, internet, gas/electricity etc). Lastly, weâre a LGBTQI+ welcoming household and embrace racial diversity.

292,Two doubles rooms in Kidbrooke house,£480 pcm,"The house is located in South East London, Kidbrooke. We have buses 2 - 10 mins away, and Kidbrooke Train Station which is 12 mins away, and next to it a PureGym, local Sainsbury's, and Aldi.  We're really close to Greenwich, Lewisham, Eltham, Blackheath, and the area is quiet and beautiful, with lots of parks.We are a couple and have been renting both rooms, using one as a bedroom and one as a living room/office space. However, both rooms are available and can be used as bedrooms.More about the house:Kitchen with lots of storage space, high speed internet, bathroom, toilet, spacious back patio & garden with space for bike storage in a shed. There is a living room but it is full of stuff so not really usable! However, you would be able to store things in there too, or hang washing, etc. Room 1This is a large double room on the ground floor. It has patio doors which open into the garden. It comes with a double bed (actually two singles pushed together, so the size of a king!), a desk, wardrobe, clothes rail, and storage unit. Room 2This is a good sized double room upstairs in the house. We have marked it as unfurnished, however it comes with two wardrobes and there is a single bed that can be used (currently stored elsewhere but we could move it).The landlady:You will be living with the landlady, who is an elderly Japanese lady. She is very lovely, kind and generous. She keeps to herself most of the time, but sometimes will require help with things around the house. She has health issues on occasion, but this usually will not impact you. She has a separate fridge that's not in the kitchen, and she rarely cooks so doesn't use the kitchen much.

294,Double room/South Quay / Gym+Spa/ 2bed&2bath,"£1,085 pcm","Hey! My flatmate is, unfortunately, going back to Italy once our contract ends so I will be looking for a new flatmate to share the flat with for the new contract (12 months starting 5th of June). About the flat / room: It is a 2 bed / 2 bathroom flat in Ability Place on the 9th floor. The room available is the smaller one, but it has the biggest bathroom (with bath & shower). It is small but cozy and has everything needed. The bed can be lifted and has storage underneath. The room does not fit a desk in it (maybe a small one potentially), but, as you can see in the photos, my current flatmate works from the living room (the desk is his but maybe can be bought from him if wanted - its a standing desk as well). I have my desk in my room and keep busy with work / appointments etc so we havenât found this to be a problem - and he works 100% from home. There is a kitchen/living room with pretty much everything needed.There is 24/7, super friendly, concierge, a spa with jacuzzi, steam room and sauna as well as a fully equipped gym which is actually quite big if compared to other resident-only gyms. It is also opened everyday, Mon-Fri 6am - 11pm and weekends 6am-10pm which is quite good. There are options for treatments, such as massage as well as personal training etc. There are also lockers in the ground floor for dry cleaning pick-ups. It is 4-5 mins walk from South Quay DLR and about 10-12 minutes from Canary Wharf Station. There is a small Tesco and a Tian Tian supermarkets right next door within seconds walk, as well as a Waitrose 10 mins walk or so. The room/flat is slightly on the lower end of the market prices at the moment (crazy) because I have negotiated a lot with the landlord / agency since I have lived in the flat for 2 years and unfortunately, had to fight cancer for the past year. I am in remission now since February, but in the process of getting my life back together and with lots of healthcare expenses! haha Bills are not included, but roughly they are per person per month: Council tax (band E): £80; Water £20; Hyperoptic Wifi: £18; Electricity: £50-90 depending on the month (or at least this has been so far, before accounting for the government electricity payments â¦) (The building has a garage, and i THINK parking is included, but i dont drive /have a car so i cant remember but i can check)About me: I am an analyst for a bank in Canary Wharf. I have been living in London for 10+ years and always shared flats. I am originally from Argentina (but I inherited an Italian passport - although i do NOT speak Italian, just Spanish and English =D ) I do like to spend time getting to know my flatmates and many of the ârandomsâ Iâve lived with have become super close friends of mine, including the one leaving now! I am super friendly, social and easygoing, but equally respectful, clean and considerate of otherâs space and privacy (as you can imagine, the social part has not been very active the past year but hey, working on getting it back). My family live in Argentina, so where I live and who I live with are very important to me. Also, It is okay to have someone over every now and then, if you want (as long as we respect each otherâs space & peace), but it is definitely not a party flat. Even though I am in finance, I used to be a dancer before, so I love all sorts of dancing & yoga and I am also a fitness enthusiast. I am not a fan of cooking but I like being healthy so this forced me to find ways to make cooking easy, nutritious and efficient :) So I cook every now and then but I am not the type that will take over the kitchen ever haha. Finally, as i mentioned, I spent the past year fighting cancer, which was tough, but out of it now and looking into going back to ânormalâ slowly. In a flatmate, I look for someone similar in terms of friendly and easy going but also respectful of each otherâs spaces. No need for OCD but clean overall. Hopefully you read the description, and If you did read this far write âability place 123â in your message and tell me a bit about yourself as well :)If you would like more photos or arrange a viewing let me know. I will probably do it over a day or two in the next couple of weeks.",Flat share,Canary Wharf,E14,https://www.spareroom.co.uk/flatshare/flatshare_detail.pl?flatshare_id=16674069&search_id=1212209861&city_id=&flatshare_type=offered&search_results=%2Fflatshare%2F%3Foffset%3D260%26search_id%3D1212209861%26sort_by%3Dby_day%26mode%3Dlist&,04 Jun 2023,12 months,None,Furnished,Yes,Yes,No,No,Yes,shared,No,No,Yes,Yes,Professional,No,Males or females,,,,Spareroom

361,Cosy Double Room in Tooting Bec Flat,£648 pcm,"Hello! I am sadly moving out of this amazing 4 bed flat in Tooting Bec after deciding to move in with my girlfriend so weâre looking for a friendly, respectful and sociable person to replace me that's looking for a home and not just a room!THE ROOMThe room is on the smaller side, so your share of the rent is slightly less. Almost everyone who has lived here has begun in this room and loved it. It comes with a comfy double bed, chest of drawers, bedside cabinet and a wardobe that sits directly outside on the landing. THE FLATSplit across two floors, there is ample space in the flat. There's a big living room/dining space with very comfortable sofas that are less than a year old. Along with the dining table there's a seperate desk that's perfect for anyone needing to WFH. We have a Sky TV that comes with lots of channels and includes Netflix. The kitchen comes with a dishwasher, washing machine and recently installed oven, large fridge-freezer, and communal utensils aplenty! There is 1 shared bathroom with a seperate toilet which comes in handy. Everyone has different schedules so there's never a queue for the shower. THE FLATMATESYou'll be living with 3 lovely people who I'm gutted to be leaving behind. Whilst they all have their own social lives and appreciate eachother's space, you can often find people watching TV together in the living room, and the house has been known to host the occasional dinner party and try their luck at local pub quizzes.Jacob works in the art sector, loves travelling, reading, writing, and a good country roast on an Autumnal Sunday.Lizzy works for a start up and loves spending her free time sewing clothes, reading, doing anything creative, hanging out with friends... and has been known to frequent a National Trust or two.Nuala works in PR, and likes reading, visiting galleries/cafes and running in her spare time.THE LOCATIONAnother huge selling point is that the flat is a stone's throw away from Tooting Common, with Tooting Bec Lido just a 10 minute walk down the road, perfect for those UK heatwaves. We're less than a 10 minute walk from Tooting Bec Station, where the Northern Line can take you to Waterloo or London Bridge in 30 mins. Balham is just a short walk away with loads of great pubs, bars, a huge Sainsbury's, Boots and Aldi. More local supermarkets are a small Sainsbury's less than 10 minutes down the road, and a brand new Tesco Express is due to open at the end of our road in the next few weeks!ADMIN BITSBills vary between summer and winter, but generally come to around £100 a month (we're fortunate to be in Council Tax Band D in Wandsworth) The move in date will be the 18th June.We'll be holding viewings ASAP, if interested please send us a message with a bit about yourself!Isaac, Jacob, Lizzy and Nuala x",Flat share,Tooting Bec,SW17,https://www.spareroom.co.uk/flatshare/flatshare_detail.pl?flatshare_id=16673327&search_id=1212209861&city_id=&flatshare_type=offered&search_results=%2Fflatshare%2F%3Foffset%3D320%26search_id%3D1212209861%26sort_by%3Dby_day%26mode%3Dlist&,18 Jun 2023,None,None,Furnished,Yes,No,No,No,No,shared,No,No,Yes,No,Professional,Yes,Males or females,,25,32,Spareroom

416,"Bright, Spacious Double Room in Gated Community",£675 pcm,"Hi hi! Welcome to Flat 13 ð¤ It pains me to say this but I am sadly leaving this lovely room and flat next month to move in together with my sister. I've had a great time in this place as it was my first flat in London - but it is now time for me to move out and give this lovely place to someone else ð Located on the top floor, this room is bright, spacious and features a cosy double bed, a built-in wardrobe with loadsss of storage space, shelves (both on the walls and standing) and a desk! I never really had time to decorate the space but there's so much potential to make it your own. The one thing I did do (the fairy lights around the edges of the ceiling) will be left to you, so you can leave them up or take them down - whatever suits you â¨ The flat is located within a gated community that requires a passcode to get in (!!) so it's veryyy safe. It's a lovely green, leafy area with so many transport links so it's easy to get around. The Surrey Quays Overground station is just a 7-minute walk away, and there are two bus stops right outside our street. There's also a Lidl supermarket just a 2-minute walk away, and a 24-hour convenience store right next to it (which is honestly the best). This is a female-only house so you will be living with three other girls, all professionals, who are just all-around lovely people. They made me feel so welcome when I moved in and are so so sweet ð This is an LGBT-friendly flat and all the girls are very chill, always happy to chat (but also understand if you want some alone time) and love watching movies and drinking wine on nights in. One of the girls has a cat named Zarina (pictured on last slide) who is just the cutest thing and is definitely one of the things I'm going to miss the most about living here ð­â¨ You will be sharing a bathroom with two of the girls, as well as the living room! They're all really considerate and leave the flat nicely clean and tidy, so someone who would do the same is ideal âº We unfortunately cannot accept any more pets as Zarina doesn't do well with other animals, and bills come to about £125 per month (already including council tax)! If you're interested in the room, please don't hesitate to send me a message! Would be happy to answer any questions you have and arrange a viewing ð¤",Flat share,Surrey Quays,SE8,https://www.spareroom.co.uk/flatshare/flatshare_detail.pl?flatshare_id=16673912&search_id=1212209861&city_id=&flatshare_type=offered&search_results=%2Fflatshare%2F%3Foffset%3D370%26search_id%3D1212209861%26sort_by%3Dby_day%26mode%3Dlist&,20 May 2023,6 months,None,Furnished,,,Yes,,,shared,Yes,No,No,No,Professional,,Female preferred,,24,28,Spareroom
417,*Friend Street* Bright double room available,"£1,010 pcm","Weâre looking for a new housemate to join us at Friend Street :)You will be living with two women (one Australian and one American) and one guy (Cuban). They're all easy-going professionals in their late twenties / thirties working in finance, robotics and production. They're an absolute pleasure to live with and the only reason I'm moving out is because I bought a house.We have varying schedules so might not all be in the house at the same time, but when we are there's a nice friendly vibe in the living area - we have dinner or watch TV / movies together when we are home.  It's generally a quiet house but we enjoy having friends over and the have impromptu dinners / BBQs / casual drinks maybe once a month. The room is a bright 2nd floor double bedroom with space for a desk.  It is south-facing and gets the best light in the house, with sunshine streaming in in the morning.  You will share a bathroom with one other room. (The house has three and a half bathrooms total - two rooms have en suites - so you rarely get in anyone's way.) There's plenty of storage: the room has one built-in wardrobe and there are also cupboards in the hallways and an attic space e. g. for suitcases. The ground floor is a spacious open-plan living room, dining area and kitchen. The house has a private back terrace with a 9-seater couch we bought last summer, plants, BBQ (and happy lights!) - itâs a great space during the summer. Thereâs also secure side access which is great for bike storage. The house is well equipped with a gas cooker, dishwasher, washing machine, dryer. The house is warm in winter and equipped with Nest products for easy control of heating cycles, etc.The house is on a quiet one-way street so there is very little traffic and noise. The location is great too.  Groceries and really nice restaurants on Exmouth Market are on your doorstep and Angel station and all the cafes, restaurants, shops and bars that Angel has to offer is super close too.  Costs & other admin info:- Monthly rent: GBP 1010- Security deposit: 1023 GBP- Bills (utilities, council tax) are not included in the room price and generally work out to about £160 - £180 pp per month (and we get a cleaner, Maria, every second week - she's £40, so £10 pp each time she comes)- Furnished: The house is fully furnished but the room is unfurnished (but does have a built-in wardrobe).  The room is available from 13 May but we could be flexible if you were after the room a little earlier. We like the gender balance of 2 women and 2 men, so we're looking for a man. If this sounds like a good fit for you, please drop us a message with some information about you and what you are looking for.  We are looking to host viewings, preferably in person but could also do online if in person is tough for you!",House share,Angel,EC1,https://www.spareroom.co.uk/flatshare/flatshare_detail.pl?flatshare_id=14395978&search_id=1212209861&city_id=&flatshare_type=offered&search_results=%2Fflatshare%2F%3Foffset%3D370%26search_id%3D1212209861%26sort_by%3Dby_day%26mode%3Dlist&,13 May 2023,12 months,None,Furnished,No,No,Yes,Yes,No,shared,No,No,No,No,Professional,No,Male preferred,,28,37,Spareroom

I work in property for a family fund in West London, mainly buying hotels. Not the most exciting and probably not what I dreamt about being as a child but it pays the bills. Iâm in the office twice a week (typically Monday & Wednesday) and then WFH the other 3 days.

Sheâs nearly 3, short haired red and white border collie and totally house trained and well behaved. She's also really clean as she's short haired and loves people and attention. She basically comes everywhere with me and weâre always out on walks. She doesn't bark :) It's really important to me that you love dogs - you'll of course have no responsibility with her but she does love a lot of love so I want her to have that. I think she suffers from a bit of anxiety - typical Londoner.I have found this house and am viewing it tomorrow (Saturday 15th) and hoping to secure it ASAP. I am wanting to get someone to sign the lease with me or I am open to couples but only one of you can be on the lease (no HMO licence) and I'd be looking for a bit more money. There is a spare bedroom that I'm thinking of putting an extra wardrobe in and turning it into an office that we can both use.You will need to provide previous rental references and be in full-time employment.Move in is mid-June as the landlord is going to repaint and freshen the place up. I want to make the house a home and although I'm independent it would be great to live with someone that will become a friend - I'm all for hosting the occasional dinner party/BBQ/drinks also!!Thanks for reading this long and winding tale...if you are interested can you please get back to me on the below?- Can you move-in on or before May 1st?- Are you able to sign a lease in the next week and leave a 5 week deposit?

Available May 1 (with a bit of wiggle room possible) as a 2-5 month sublet, for £835/mo exc. bills as one of our housemates is moving out. There is a deposit of £835 (1 monthâs rent) and benefits are accepted if needed.The HouseThe house is a cute Victorian 4 bed on a quiet street in Homerton with a large kitchen/dining room (filled with more cooking equipment than youâll ever need) thatâs great for hanging out + having people over, and thereâs an additional cosy living room plus upstairs bathroom. Location is also great. Weâre a 7 minute walk from Homerton station and there are local pubs/shops and Chatsworth Road Market on the weekends if thatâs your vibe.The room itself is a double, with space for a desk and drawers etc. As current housemate is taking most of her stuff It comes with minimal furniture (bed and mattress) but we have some spare furniture in the basement that you can use if you donât have your own.The HousematesThere are currently 4 of us living in the house. Ali (cis female), Stu, Joe and Dan (3 cis males, 1 couple). Weâre all queer, so as you can imagine weâre a very queer friendly house. Ideally, weâre looking for someone who is keen to be part of the house and not just rent a room. So, we want someone who is on the same wavelength as us. We all work full time (in design and marketing) so things are pretty chill in the week bar the odd trip to the pub/dinner/movie night. Weâre a very social bunch though, so on weekends, we do like to go out to galleries/parties and have people over and get the speakers out in the kitchen. That being said, we are respectful of each other all the time.We also love to cook, so youâll probably get spoiled with a ridiculous dinner from time to time.In terms of other house interests, they include: music, design, food, fashion, film, festivals, art, psychology, games.If this sounds right for you, drop us a message with a bit about yourself and weâll reach out to you about viewings etc. ð",Flat share,Hackney,E5,https://www.spareroom.co.uk/flatshare/flatshare_detail.pl?flatshare_id=16673509&search_id=1212209861&city_id=&flatshare_type=offered&search_results=%2Fflatshare%2F%3Foffset%3D430%26search_id%3D1212209861%26sort_by%3Dby_day%26mode%3Dlist&,01 May 2023,2 months,5 months,Furnished,No,No,Yes,No,No,shared,Yes,No,Yes,Yes,Don't mind,No,Males or females,,,,Spareroom

838,Lrg Dbl/Quiet Apartment/Right Beside Canal & Tube!,£790 pcm,"FULLY FURNISHED DOUBLE/QUIET & SAFE AREA/BESIDE MILE END TUBE/GREAT HOUSEMATES!/PARK, CANAL & GYM BEHIND APARTMENT (AMAZING LOCATION)Available May 1st. No smokers please. Shared house bills outlined below.I am actually so much fun, but have had to make this ad really direct and it might come across a bit harsh (so sorry about that!). There are many people messaging wasting our time. We decided we needed to be quite direct so we only receive messages from people who are looking for the same things in a houseshare as us :) Thanks for understanding!You are living with 1 well educated, professional couple (in their late 30's) & 1 academic researcher working for a professor at London School of Economics (in her late 20's). We all value our own private space and we give you yours too. We are warm and welcoming people. We love maintaining a positive energy in the house. We'd like to live with someone who is not expecting to hang out regularly with their housemates. We all have busy lives and want to live with someone who, like us, does their own thing. But of course, we are all cordial and friendly when we greet eachother in passing, or have chats in the communal areas!This is a no smoking & no vaping apartment so please do not apply if you smoke/vape. Please only apply if you value a tranquil, home environment. We want to live with a person who keeps regular hours (instead of coming home at 3am every night). Your friends/family are welcome, but we prefer to live with someone who is not bringing strangers back to the apartment regularly. Hopefully this suits you! We are fully Covid vaccinated and expect our flatmate to be also :)About the room:The room comes fully furnished with a double bed & new mattress. You will need to bring your own pillows, sheets & bed clothes for the bed (this is the norm in London). There is plenty of storage â a wardrobe, seperate built in wardrobe, chest of drawers, shelving. You have a solid work desk with additional storage built into it, and an ergonomic (back supporting) chair in your room, for setting up your work station or laptop. All of that furniture is included! Your bedroom get lots of natural light. The sunset also comes in, lighting it up magically every evening.Whatâs included:There is equal storage space allocated for you in the kitchen cupboards, refrigerator and freezer. Plenty of space for 1 person! The kitchen is fully kitted out with all crockery, cooking appliances and utensils you need for eating, drinking, cooking. You are welcome to bring your own also.Breakdown of fees:Room price is £820. All bills & household extras on top of that are £100. This includes: gas, electricity, water and high-speed fibre optic broadband, bins, recycling, council tax. Even toilet roll & shared cleaning products! You dont need to buy anything for the house or communal areas. If we itemised it you would be paying more, but because we dont have the time to split every single bill with a fine tooth comb 4 ways every month, it is easier for us to give you a substantially reduced rate overall and it always remains the same amount. Even though household bills are increasing alarmingly throughout the UK, we do not vary what we charge you - it is always only £100 per month. So the full amount you pay is £920. We also take care of all maintenance and upgrades of the communal areas of the apartment included in that too! There are no other charges.On top of that, you have use of our washing machine, tumble dryer, ironing board, iron, hairdryer. Everything you need is provided! There is no TV, but there is high speed internet if you wish to watch things on your laptop.About the apartment:It's quiet, secure, clean & get's plenty of natural light from the large windows throughout. It's a 3 bedroom apartment split over 2 levels. This is a great apartment and all bedrooms are really spacious, so the first to view will want to move in! The bedroom in the video is NOT your room. We included the video to give you a feel for the apartment layout in communal areas. The photos attached show your bedroom! It is the largest bedroom in the apartment. There is a fully equipped kitchen / dining area that has a built in dining booth downstairs. There is no communal livingroom with couches. There are 2 toilets and 1 bathtub in the apartment (with hot power shower). Both bathrooms are tiled beautifully recently and are kept really clean. All bedrooms have new high grade anti-bacterial carpets. Locks on the bedroom doors add to the security for you. You can see the skyscrapers of Canary wharf as you walk along the entrance balcony at the front of the apartment! Beautiful view when lit up in the evening.We have really nice British families as neighbours either side of us who have been here years, so it is a lovely safe & quiet location to be in. Walking home at night is very safe on well lit wide streets. I am a girl, do it regularly alone, and have for a few years now, and have always felt safe. We are only a 4 minute walk down 1 straight street from Mile End tube station!Location:Mile End is one of the best places to be located in London as it is so central and a great transport hub. The tube station is a 4 minute walk along a safe, flat road from my apartment. It has so many public transport routes going through it, 3 tube lines with trains every 60 seconds, and 4 bus routes outside taking you to Tower Bridge, Piccadilly or Stratford Westfield (it is 1 stop away & the biggest shopping centre in Europe). Making it very convenient to get all around the city fast! Directly behind my apartment are another 3 bus routes that service Canary Wharf, Hackney and Dalston. You can go in every direction easily on public transport from my place. The easy access to every area is why I chose this exact location to live in!The apartment is located in between 3 green areas. So the air is the cleanest & pure in the city. The pretty Regents Canal river runs behind the apartment block & is lovely to walk along in the early evening. Walk north along the canal and you reach Victoria Park in 8 minutes with great coffee spots and bakeries all week, then there's a fab Farmers Market in the park every Sunday. My apartment is honestly a dream location! There are lots of independent shops, micro breweries in the area (Crate, Howling Hops, Old St Brewery) and farmers markets happening on the weekend. Columbia Road Flower Market (Sunday) has lots of quirky independent shops too, then Broadway Market (Saturday) packed with the best British produce, live musicians and hot food stalls.Mile End stadium and gym is across the road, a 30 second walk from the apartment. It has a really cheap, well equipped gym & swimming pool. Prices start at £30 per month to join, itâs great & the cheapest in the city. £4 to use the sauna without being a member and £6 to swim in their Olympic sized pool!Transport links:Tube (from Mile End station): Central line, District line, Hammersmith & City line. Bus routes 277, D6, D7, 205, 25.1 tube stop, 60 seconds travel time from Mile End (Whitechapel/Stratford tube stations): Overground line, Crossrail line, DLR line, Jubilee line, Elizabeth line.Distance by tube from apartment: Stratford Westfield Shopping Centre (biggest in Europe), 2 minutes. Bethnal Green, 3 minutes. Bank station, 8 minutes. Canary Wharf, 8 minutes. Oxford Circus 16 minutes. London Bridge & Borough Market 16 minutes. Tower of London, 6 minutes. Hammersmith, 45 minutes.About us:We are a well educated, friendly couple, in our 30âs. White, British. We have a lovely academic researcher living with us. She is thoughtful, respectful of personal space and super polite. She is British with Chinese heritage. We are very welcoming and full of positive energy. We are your housemates! We are clean, tidy, quiet when moving about the apartment. Just generally, considerate & respectful people. We are looking for someone normal & kind, who genuinely appreciates a positive home environment. Please do not apply if you are a really untidy person or lead a chaotic life of late nights. Please only apply if you are respectful in keeping the communal areas in decent shape, just as we do. We are really relaxed, but do enjoy living in a clean house. So it's important the person moving in values tidiness too! We'd like it if you are in fulltime employment and you have some sort of routine to your week. The odd late night is fine, but we don't want to live with someone who comes in at 3am, bringing strangers back. All 3 of us have fulltime jobs with a pretty regular weekday routine. So I just need to say that in advance. About you:We are looking for a professional from any industry sector who leaves the apartment to go to work a few days a week, not someone who works from home fulltime. Someone who has a happy demeanour. Someone who is considerate of other people they live with and happy to keep the communal areas respectfully tidy after using them, for the benefit of everyone in the house. We all keep it really spotless in the communal areas, so that it's nice for everyone to use. This apartment is not suitable for a smoker/vaper. We want to live with people who appreciate a quiet, calm, safe home where they know who is coming and going from the apartment. So our place is not suitable for a party person who plans social gatherings or bringing strangers/random people back regularly. For your piece of mind, we don't bring friends or strangers to the apartment, maybe just family who visit once or twice a year, for lunch and a park walk.Please get in touch to arrange a viewing.

It's a nice and quiet area within a 10 minute walk from Manc city centre. There is one shared bathroom in the property, one off road parking space (my own) but I think there is an option to apply for an on street parking permit within Hulme if you need your own parking. I own a lot of gym equipment which I don't mind sharing and while not in the pictures there's a TV in the living room. No pets are allowed in the flat.The rent might be a little negotiable. It includes internet (Hyperoptic 250mb), electric & water but not council tax (I'm assuming an extra ~£70 a month / Council Tax band C). I have 6 months left on my current contract. After this I'm not sure if the owners are coming back or whether I can extend the contract if I wanted. Either way I'll be living in Manc a few more years so it would be ideal to find someone I could flat share with further to the 6 months if things go well.The room:A pretty decent sized room that comes with a desk and lots of storage. The bed is a pull out but my previous tenant had no issues leaving it out. The current mattress might look thin but is surprisingly comfortable. Myself:I work as a clinical scientist, currently work on site but I will get 2 WFH days later on. I'm a tidy and considerate housemate who enjoys cooking, outdoor trips, gaming, going to gigs, exercise, anything geeky and pubbing.Who I'm looking for:I'm looking for someone who is relatively tidy, pretty relaxed and must be considerate to my work schedule in the week. Bonus if there was an overlap of interests and some social elements to the flat share.

Currently this is available from mid May to the 5th August.The dates may be flexible by a week or so depending on my current flatmates travelling arrangements so feel free to ask about that as it's possible I could accommodate different moving dates.The room itself is set on the top floor of a semi detached house that I share with my 8 year old daughter and my dog Alan. I work from home most of the month.You would have a superking bed and a newly refurbished ensuite bathroom, it's a bright spacious room. It has plenty of wardrobe and storage space.The rest of the house has an open kitchen and dining room, two living rooms that can be separated if needed. One room is the TV room and the other is more of a quiet space with a log burner and record player. The house has a small garden to the rear, with a BBQ and table/chairs. Super fast broadband is included and I have a mesh WiFi system in the house so you'll have decent speed/connection everywhere. The location is great for the bus or train into Manchester, with stops only a few mins walk away. One stop (7 mins) into Manchester Piccadilly and Manchester Oxford road on the train. The hospital is also a walkable distance. Unrestricted on-street parking is available right outside the house.Bills - (gas/electric, council tax, broadband, water) are included in the price, as well as a fortnightly cleaner. I live with my 8 year old daughter half of the time, I also have a 1 year old puppy who is a bit crazy as well so you'd need to be child and dog friendly! The house is quite large so you'd have plenty of space for yourself should you want it. Generally it's a very chilled household really, I'd like a housemate who could be respectful of that and someone who wants a similar environment for themselves.I'm very laid back, sociable and easy to get on with, i like to to listen to music and go to gigs, cooking food, watch movies/tv, most sports and i enjoy getting out hiking as much as time allows.",House share,Levenshulme,M19,https://www.spareroom.co.uk/flatshare/flatshare_detail.pl?flatshare_id=16361995&search_id=1212213745&city_id=&flatshare_type=offered&search_results=%2Fflatshare%2F%3Foffset%3D40%26search_id%3D1212213745%26sort_by%3Dby_day%26mode%3Dlist&,19 May 2023,None,3 months,Furnished,Yes,No,Yes,Yes,No,shared,Yes,Yes,No,No,Don't mind,No,Males or females,,24,,Spareroom

1415,Double en-suite bedroom in city centre,£708 pcm,"Hi ! I am looking for someone to take over my current flatmates tenancy. The room is a double bed with an en-suite including a bath. The flat is a two bedroom on the 15th floor with great views over the city - which makes the balcony that much nicer! The flat is the perfect location, only a 10 minute walk to Arndale and 5 minute to Spinningfield. The building complex includes ;- 24hr reception - Gym - Communal work spaces - Free wifi - Parking at a cost of £150 per month Cost breakdown ;Rent: £708Electricity: £59Water: £18.26Council tax: £92Total: £877.26Deposit: £660 About me ;Last August I moved to Manchester on my own from Portsmouth and now I work in insurance in spinningfield. I like going to the gym, eating out, going for drinks and watching horror films. I am a positive, friendly and talkative person. I am also vegan so you would have to be respectful of that. I want to live with someone that I would be friends with - not just share a flat with. I know it is quite early to be advertising the room, itâs just that the building management require a changeover of tenancy to be submitted by June 8th so you would have to be committed by then. I am up for doing viewings (would have to be after 5pm on weekdays) and meeting beforehand to see if we are a good match.

1423,Peaceful/Quirky place. Big wild garden.,£550 pcm,"Hi, I'm Jake, and I'm looking for somebody nice to share my house. I have a double room that will be available from the 1st of June, but I'm not in a rush. I'm more interested in the finding the right fit.  It's an unusual place and is still partly work in progress. Whilst the house may look a bit rough on the outside it is very nicely renovated on the inside and the room itself would be in beautiful condition.  It's currently occupied by myself and Marina(a postgraduate student in visual anthropology)  I'd describe the vibe as very peaceful and friendly, so might suit a mature student or someone doing PHD. Perhaps someone wanting a place for a year or two rather than to settle longer term. Given the recent massive hike in bills costs, someone with student status would be preferable as it makes the council tax cheaper(Council tax is band C but this is included in the rent, so if I accept a professional person I'll need to increase the rent a little to £585)I work in the performing arts, my time is split between work/tinkering with projects,  home/garden, spending time with my partner in Leeds(she rarely comes here) and more recently I spend a lot of time in Scotland looking after aged parents. So a lot of the time it would just be 2 people in a pretty decent sized house.   The house features a crazy big wild garden out  back.(very much work in progress.... nature is  perhaps doing most of the work here)  We're both sociable and friendly and enjoy preparing and sharing food when time allows but are also quite independent.  It would be nice to have someone who would similarly enjoy a bit of sharing without feeling obliged.  It's important to us to keep a tidy ship so someone who is happy/enthusiastic about keeping things very clean and tidying up as they go would be a good fit. We're neither of us big fans of alcohol consumption/boozy culture, but certainly not prudish and do have the odd glass with food. I'm open to the idea of renting  a room furnished or unfurnished and might also consider short term let with the right person. I may be a little slow replying to messages because I've got a lot on, but If you think you might be a good match, message and tell us a bit about yourself and what you're looking for. Look forward to hearing from you. Cheers.

Kitchen has recently been refurbished and has plenty of space, has a new boiler installed, a new oven, new fridge and new washing machine.â¢ Upstairs - 3 double bedrooms and bathroom â Like the kitchen the bathroom is relatively new with shower unit installed fairly recently.â¢ Outdoor space at the back.â¢ Youâre welcome to decorate your room how youâd likeA bit about the area:â¢ Old Trafford is just south of the city centre in the middle of other popular areas such as Chorlton, Didsbury, Sale, Altrincham, Salford Quays & Deansgate.â¢ On a clear run it takes less than a 10 min drive from the house straight up Chester Rd to the city centre.â¢ 5 min drive away from M60 motorway which loops all the way around Manchester.â¢ Plenty of buses which take 20 mins to reach Piccadilly Gardens, and Stretford Metrolink is a 10/15 min walk away, which can take you through and all around Greater Manchester. Old Trafford and Wharfside also nearby depending which direction / line you need.â¢ Trafford Centre (3rd biggest shopping centre in UK) is 10 min drive away and easy to get to by tram & bus. Manchester Arndale also easy to get to by getting the tram to Market Street.â¢ Big Tesco is a 2 min drive up Chester Rd and Co-op shop 2 min walk. White City retail park is also next to Tesco.â¢ Bridgewater Canal is a great cycling or walking route that takes you all the way through Sale and Altrincham and into Dunham Massey, or up into Castlefield / City centre.â¢ Match days at Old Trafford always bring an exciting atmosphere to the area. Tickets can be expensive/hard to get for popular games but it is definitely something you should experience, especially an evening game. The cricket stadium gets used for England games plus Harry Styles, Red Hot Chilli's and The Killlers played there a few months ago.â¢ Salford Quays is a 15/20 min walk away and has loads of bars & restaurants, shopping centre, cinema, the Lowry Theatre, Imperial War Museum, and MediaCityUK where the BBC and ITV film a lot of their shows. Van Gogh Alive and Lightwaves are based here too.â¢ O2 Victoria Warehouse is 15 min walk away and is a great venue for music events, usually disco/house/techno. The Warehouse Project used to be held here (you canât hear anything from the house).â¢ Choice of 3 nearby gyms available â PureGym Stretford & NRG Gym both 10/15min walk away, PureGym Exchange Quay 20 min walk away.â¢ Overall a popular area going through early gentrification stages yet still quite family orientated. Loads of things to do to keep you happy and entertained.In terms of myself, Iâm a 28 year old male working professional, sometimes in the office sometimes at home, who owns the house. Very keen on travelling and music events, I tend to go out in the evenings quite regularly and spend the weekend in London visiting friends about once a month.

1462,Double room in 2 bed flat close to city centre,£375 pcm,"Hello! Iâm Georgia and Iâm looking for a new flatmate as mine is sadly moving to India.Iâve been living in this flat for two years now and I love it - itâs cosy and in a great location, a 20 minute walk to the city centre (without paying city centre prices!). The flat itself is a first floor, 2 bedroom 1 bathroom flat in a block of 6 (3 stories high, 2 flats on each floor, shared central stairwell - no lift Iâm afraid). It is council tax band A so we currently pay £131 a month split between two. The flat also has a small balcony that Iâve got 2 chairs and a table on and gets the sun in the afternoon/evening. There is a shared kitchen, bathroom, and living/dining space. And plenty of storage!Your bedroom comes with a double bed+mattress, a lovely big desk with a drawers, a freestanding wardrobe and a built in wardrobe. The rest of the flat is furnished as youâd imagine. Bills usually come to as follows:Gas and electric: £90 a month (although subject to change what with everything going on)Water: £55 a monthCouncil tax: £131 a monthWifi: £25 a month (weâve got hyperoptic fibre optic cables so super fast)Then this is split equally between the two tenants so comes to about £150 each. Plus rent that makes monthly expenditure £525I work from home every day - my job is completely remote and there isnât an office for me to go into so I have a desk in the living room that I work at. My current housemate also works from home (both bedrooms do have desks that we go to for meetings) and itâs great - so Iâm happy for whatever work situations really, work from home, hybrid or fully in the office I really donât mind. A bit about me: I am super clean and tidy! Iâm a vegetarian and would prefer to live in a meat free home. I work for an anti-poverty charity and am quite political (so no tories please lol). I really value having a comfortable and relaxing home, and so weeknights are always quiet. Iâm not a massive drinker but I do like to go for gentle pints down the pub, or out to nice bars with friends at the weekend. I like to keep busy and out of the house a lot (since Iâm here all the time for work!) so most nights Iâm out doing my hobbies or visiting friends - I love to cook and host people for dinner too. I pole dance,  Iâm a big reader, I enjoy creative pursuits like pottery, I love getting out in nature for hikes etc, and Iâm at the Buddhist centre most weeks. Iâve lived in Manchester since I came to uni here in 2017 (minus a year abroad). I am looking for someone to move in who is likeminded and shares interests, so that we can genuinely be friends. But I am also respectful of privacy and giving each other space! I would like someone who values having a clean and relaxing sanctuary kind of home, but also likes to get out and have fun! I would prefer someone who is veggie/vegan, and someone who is thoughtful and considerate of others. Please give me a message if you think this sounds good - Iâm happy to meet up for a drink or a coffee to get to know each other!

1505,1 room available in 3 bed flat! Close to centre,£500 pcm,"My current flatmate is moving out in April as he decided to live with his girlfriend - traitor I know, right? (jk, happy for him haha). That said, we've got 1 room available in this cosy apartment on the 9th floor!Room and the apartment:It's a decent size double bedroom. You'd have a cute view and see sunsets as it's facing west. The apartment has 3 bathrooms (1 ensuite that's taken and 2 to share between two tenants). So technically you and the other person would share the shower in one of the bathrooms but apart from that you'd have one all to yourself with the toilet and all that (pretty cool isn't it?)There's obviously a shared living room (which btw is decorated differently than in the photo) and a kitchen with all equipment needed. Also, we've got a balcony overlooking the canal :). The view is cute too.  Rent/Bills: Bills are not included in the rent but the broadband is. In total, they come to around £140/150 a month (it can vary slightly monthly due to the electricity but I'm planning to find a provider with lower rates). There's a deposit of £567. You will be signing the agreement with the agency owning the building so you'll probably need to go through all the checks, references etc.About current flatmates:There's two guys (one of them being me lol).  I'd say we're really easy-going people. We're both sociable, clean, and talkative, yet obviously like to spend time in our rooms. Just FYI, for most of the time I work from home. The other guy in a hybrid setting. Personally, I'm into gym, music, photography, podcasts and a few other bits. About you:Just be a decent pers, I guess. If you clean after yourself, like to have a decent convo every now and then, and are relatively easy-going too, that'd be great!If you would like to know anything else or arrange a viewing please get in touch or ask any additional questionsThanks,Mac",Flat share,Castlefield,M15,https://www.spareroom.co.uk/flatshare/flatshare_detail.pl?flatshare_id=16600994&search_id=1212213745&city_id=&flatshare_type=offered&search_results=%2Fflatshare%2F%3Foffset%3D440%26search_id%3D1212213745%26sort_by%3Dby_day%26mode%3Dlist&,17 Apr 2023,11 months,None,Furnished,Yes,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,shared,Yes,No,Yes,Yes,Professional,Yes,Males or females,,21,36,Spareroom

I work in professional services in the city centre, and have lived here for around a year now (but have worked here for 5).I'd consider myself really laid back and social generally, and am genuinely up for doing anything. When not working I enjoy cooking, playing/watching football (big Blackburn rovers fan), playing guitar (may hear me warbling in there too), bouldering, walking in the peak district, or going out for food/drinks in town with friends. Love exploring what Manchester has to offer, and always happy to have someone come along if you're new to the city!Also, I'm currently studying for a professional qualification alongside work so am very mindful of those who may need to do the same, and would expect the same from anyone planning on moving in. However, I will generally study in the office so as to keep things separate.Ideal flatmate would be someone who is up for socialising but equally happy doing their own thing! --------------------Any questions just let us know, and we'll try to answer as promptly as we can ð",Flat share,Ancoats,M4,https://www.spareroom.co.uk/flatshare/flatshare_detail.pl?flatshare_id=16167790&search_id=1212213745&city_id=&flatshare_type=offered&search_results=%2Fflatshare%2F%3Foffset%3D450%26search_id%3D1212213745%26sort_by%3Dby_day%26mode%3Dlist&,12 Jun 2023,12 months,None,Furnished,,,,,,shared,No,No,No,No,Professional,,Males or females,,18,,Spareroom

1608,Double room available in apartment in Ancoats,£600 pcm,"Hello! Are you searching for a tranquil room in a beautiful apartment located in the sought-after Ancoats area? I am seeking someone to come and rent this delightful double room in my home. The atmosphere is calm and inviting, perfect for someone who values a peaceful living environment. Not only is the space super comfortable, I also like to keep it clean and tidy. Im looking for someone who also values a fresh and clutter-free space. The room is the smaller of the two, but itâs still a sizable space and comes fully furnished, including a cozy double bed, wardrobe, and a desk plus a handy set of small drawers (if needed, the desk and drawers can be removed). Youâll have access to the main bathroom which is also kept sparkling clean. I have an en-suite so thereâs never any issue with waiting for a shower in the morning. The main bathroom is shared, so I use it for occasional baths and guests use the loo etc. The open-plan living area is a fantastic place to relax and unwind, with plenty of natural light and a relaxing day bed that's even more comfortable than a sofa! I love to drink morning coffee here, watch TV in the evenings and occasionally use this space to work from. When it comes to catching the morning sun, the balcony is your go-to, and the complex is ultra-safe and secure with lovely, respectful neighbors as well. If youâre searching for a clean, tidy, and inviting apartment and a friendly person to live with (whoâs also a good cook), contact me today to book a viewing. A bit about me:I am a vegan, so Iâd be keen to share my home with a like-minded individual who shares my passion for healthy, conscious living. However, if you're a meat-eater, that's okay! As long as you clean up after yourself after cooking and eating, we'll get along just fine. While I value my own space, I'm usually up for a friendly chat and enjoy watching Netflix series together in the evenings. If I'm not relaxing at home, you'll find me exploring the cafes and bars in Ancoats and NQ with my friends. As a yoga enthusiast, I often start my day with a morning session in the living room. Donât worry, the soundproofing in the apartment is pretty good. I'm not much of a drinker and I donât smoke. Iâm looking to live with someone else whoâs not a heavy drinker and is also a non-smoker. Itâs definitely not a party house (large gatherings are prohibited in the complex) but I do enjoy hosting a casual dinner party with friends from time to time. My apartment is my sanctuary, and I'm searching for someone who will respect it as much as I do.Thank you!",Flat share,Ancoats,M4,https://www.spareroom.co.uk/flatshare/flatshare_detail.pl?flatshare_id=16664603&search_id=1212213745&city_id=&flatshare_type=offered&search_results=%2Fflatshare%2F%3Foffset%3D540%26search_id%3D1212213745%26sort_by%3Dby_day%26mode%3Dlist&,06 May 2023,3 months,None,Furnished,,,,Yes,,shared,Yes,No,No,No,Professional,Yes,Males or females,Yes,28,50,Spareroom

The private bathroom is at ground floor( shower, toilet, sink) with a key. Preferred lodgers are âClean, quiet and niceâ. No working from home 4 days a week. You should be out and not inside the house 24 hours a day. Location is close to the Universities, City centre, Plattfields park and amenities.The  bills are shared into 4 even if you are the only lodger and if you pay Council tax, pay a 1/4 share. I have an extension built, currently decorating stage.Put the date: start and end of stay if you are interested. A character and financial references are required.Description: The house is in a well located nicely furnished/decorated 3 bed semi with new 2 storey extension. Allocated parking available for 2-3 cars. The house is located just south of Plattfields park on a quiet cul de sac. It's modern and thereâs a combined  room for kitchen /diner ( no lounge area) .

Further walk, bus Stops to ride reaching within few minutes to Levenshulme, Oxford road, City Centre, Didsbury, Trafford Centre and Manchester Airport.If you are looking for long term rent, contracts can be renewed.   The rate is for single occupancy per room. Therefore, not too much baggage as thereâs not a lot of room for a modern house. Happy to share my basic kitchen stuff or other basic house appliances. But you need to buy items you preferred as my stuff are basics only.Itâs my holiday house with the right insurance for lodgers. I stay in the same house with the lodgers.     Room rents are for single occupancy only.  Not interested on accepting partners, couples using the room. Not for that kind of rental.     A day rent  can be negotiable but £30/day per person. Daily, preferably weekly or can be longer rent. I preferred  longer rental if there are plenty of applicants to choose from.     I require  holding deposit (£100) if booking is more than a weekâs wait. On the moving date, advance payment of a rent and completion of full deposit is required ( holding deposit is part of deposit). A WhatsApp chat will help you too to know my area and people living in the house including me before viewing.I look for a nice person, no drugs, no binge drinker, no criminal records and happy to tidy after themselves. We wash and put away clean dishes and not leave by the sink. This is not a party house. Best to mention all these rules to save your time. All appliances, windows, doors are closed when you leave the room .Previous lodgers were exchange student âERASMUS programâ, masters and PHD students. Currently, working professionals.  No Council tax .I will get back to you ASAP.The current kitchen and bathroom on the picture are for sharing. Thereâs no shared living room as the living room is currently made to a second kitchen for my use.Guide only: quiet at times (respect a regular working hours of 9-5 pm, therefore the house is ready to calm at 10 pm for people who work early morning). Friday to Saturday evening is fine for relax living.If you are extending rent, price may change to lower rent but we have to share bills.Guide of current usage during March 2023 Monthly bills divided by 4 person= gas and electric ( £85), Council tax- £40, Wifi - £7, water- £12.5 per person.

1694,Professional Pet Friendly Penthouse Great Location,£850 pcm,"Hey everyone, due to some changes at work I need to move and hoping to find someone to take over the last month of the lease. The contract is being renegotiated for June onwards if you wished to stay.The flat is on the 16th floor penthouse right smack in between Manchester and Salford. Manchester Victoria is 15 min walk away and Uni of Salford is 5 mins (and very visible from the views from our windows on the 16th floor).There are two rooms up for grabs. Mine, which has an ensuite included (currently occupied by yours truly) and another room without the ensuite, both available from May 1st.The rent is what it currently works out at with all the bills included and split evenly including council tax.. With the ensuite being an extra £50 pcm. A parking space is available at the building with an additional cost or there is on street parking. I'm sorry I have no idea how much, I think it's somewhere around an extra £100 a month.You'll be living with Nicole for the month of May, who honestly has kept me sane. She handles all the bills and everything to do with the flat. I (and you would) just give her the money each month and she takes care of everything. She is extremely clean, often cleaning the whole flat just because she enjoys it (I could never!) but she is in no way pushy about being clean.There are two dogs at the flat, owned by Nicole. I honestly love them and am very sad to be saying goodbye. Nicole takes care of them completely, the only thing I do is let them out to the balcony to go bathroom every once in a while.1) Chase the Husky is adorable and a huge cuddle monster. He is extremely gentle and calm and quiet, I often forget he is home. He's a great boyo.2) Chica is the Shiba. She's very affectionate and loves to present you with toys in the morning. She loves to play tug and trying to catch laser lights and shadows (be careful with your shoes, there is a shoe rack).On top of the ensuite and main bathroom on the upper floor with the rooms there is a third bathroom on the lower floor. Essentially you could all have a bathroom each if you wanted.There is a gym on site. This is included in the rent.Get in touch!

The flat is clean, quiet and comfortable but the buzz of Ancoats and the Northern Quarter are on your doorstep.

This is a quiet flat. We are both private but friendly.

The rent is payable monthly in advance with all utility bills, council tax, broadband and TV licence included. The rent is £675 per calendar month including all bills except if you work from home.. The refundable deposit is £675. There is no parking available with the flat but there may be free on street parking or pay parking nearby. If you do not work from home or are regularly away from home, and therefore not using as much energy, I am willing to negotiate on the rent. I'm into languages, particularly French and Spanish. I've travelled all over the world except for South America which is definitely on my list. I love to cook and I think I'm a pretty good cook and baker. I love to watch Gogglebox and documentaries.

I just bought the flat & it's my first ever non-rented home, so still settling in.It more or less furnished as you can see from the pics (proud to say it's mostly Freecycle & Marketplace gems!), but there may be 1 or 2 things needed still that I'm acquiring as I go.  The room to rent is furnished & fully ready to live in, but equally if you had some furniture you needed to store in there I'm sure we could move things around to make it work, or elsewhere in the flat too.The flat is 2 bright & spacious double bedrooms,  a separate bathroom, then a spacious and again bright living room with a galley kitchen coming off it.  It's in a block that is opposite Alexandra Park and while half the block faces the park, my flat faces the car park haha.  That's actually great though as the sun sets on that side, so from the early afternoon until sunset it's flooded with light, and the light isn't waking you up in the morning.  Most windows face onto the car park, but 1 faces towards the park, meaning you can work or eat at the table and see into the park.The flat is filled with plants, and tbh I've spent more on them than the furniture combined!  There's a few in the room for rent, and of course you can bring any more alongside the rest of your belongings! If you're a cyclist you could bring this into the building and keep it outside the flat door, or equally you could keep it in the bedroom.  There are bike rails in the car park if you choose to take that risk (I don't!).The price is currently set for an individual, but if you're a couple drop me a message and we can have a chat about what it would be!

1839,"Ensuite, Double BedRoom avaialble in a shared flat",£500 pcm,"Hi everyone. I currently stay in Duet, Salford Quays, Manchester and having to leave very soon due to personal reasons. I am looking for someone to take over my tenancy from the 20th of April (ideally) or later. It's a two bedroom flat, with one room occupied by my friends (couple) and I have a double bedroom, ensuite with me. We share the kitchen and living room, but have our own separate toilets/bathrooms. The flat is fully furnished and I am happy to leave the  study table I bought. The flat is in is a lovely building (Duet) having an on site gym, conference room, garden/skydeck, 24 hour concierge and a resident lounge with free coffee. We also have a social every Friday (where free drinks are provided for residents to socialise); Wellness Wednesdays (Free Yoga, HIIT, Strength Training Sessions); pet socials and other events regularly. The building has a tram and bus station right as you step outside (with trams to the city centre taking 20 mins) and; Mediacity with host of pubs, cafes, restaurants and a Sainsbury's at a walking distance. You also get the waterfront right behind the building and a lovely walking path besides the canal to walk, jog etc. My contract is until October 12th 2023 and you'll have a 6 months contract remaining from the 12th of April (the rent due date is the 12th of every month, rent paid in advance for the next month). But if you're looking for sometime later, we can work something out. We are looking for a professional, because for students you ideally need a guarantor (but feel free to reach out and we can see if something can be done about it). We have a very chilled, respectful vibe in the flat, and although we like hanging out together, we are very mindful of each other's privacy. Would like to find someone who enjoys as such. Bills (council tax, heating, gas) come to around 100-150 pounds per person, per month (broadband included in rent), so you are looking at around 600 - 650 pounds per month including rent. PS: Cooking non-vegetarian food in the house is an issue, since my current flatmates are religiously vegetarian. Of course, eating anything in your room is fine, but if not being able to cook non-vegetarian food is a deal breaker, I am really sorry. If you'd be interested, please let me know and we can arrange to meet/have a viewing for you. Meanwhile you can check the building social media.",Flat share,Salford Quays,M50,https://www.spareroom.co.uk/flatshare/flatshare_detail.pl?flatshare_id=16656319&search_id=1212213745&city_id=&flatshare_type=offered&search_results=%2Fflatshare%2F%3Foffset%3D780%26search_id%3D1212213745%26sort_by%3Dby_day%26mode%3Dlist&,Now,None,6 months,Furnished,Yes,,Yes,,Yes,shared,Yes,No,Yes,Yes,Professional,Yes,Males or females,Yes,21,,Spareroom

1882,Small cheap double bed room in Ancoats,£250 pcm,"Hello!So I've decided to rent out my second bedroom and I'm only asking for £250 per month all inclusive.The reason for this is that, whilst the bedroom has a double bed and desk, it is fairly small and also about half the wardrobe is being used for storing clothes so it doesn't have a lot of room left. There are however other storage areas in the flat that you could use.Given that my bedroom as an en suite bathroom, the main bathroom would be used just by yourself.The flat has a really nice living room with a big TV, Netflix, Amazon Prime etc and a huge private terrace which is lovely in the summer :)The other reason why I've decided to ask for such a low rent is that I spend most of the time in the living room, WFH but also making electronic music in the evenings, although i mainly use headphones so you can still chill on the sofa and watch TV.I work 3 days a week nigt shifts somewhere else however so you would have the flat for yourself 3 nights a week.I am flexible in terms of the duration of the share, anywhere between 1 to 4 months but could also extend this potentially.. Someone also into music production, singing etc would be ideal but not a must :)Any questions please ask :)",Flat share,Ancoats,M4,https://www.spareroom.co.uk/flatshare/flatshare_detail.pl?flatshare_id=16653311&search_id=1212213745&city_id=&flatshare_type=offered&search_results=%2Fflatshare%2F%3Foffset%3D820%26search_id%3D1212213745%26sort_by%3Dby_day%26mode%3Dlist&,Now,1 month,6 months,Furnished,No,No,Yes,Yes,No,shared,Yes,No,Yes,No,Don't mind,Yes,Males or females,,,,Spareroom

I'm super respectful of personal space (I defo need my own at times) but I also love to get to know people and have a laugh. Always up for a good TV show or film and love to be out and about experiencing Manchester and the surrounding areas. It's rare that I do an all day fester on the sofa nowadays.

Hopefully the odd outing and games night too. Sorry gays but for personal reasons I'm currently only open to females and straight men. It will just be me and you so the personality match is very important.An important thing to know about me is that I'm a recovering addict and completely sober. My party days are behind me and as a result I sadly can't have booze in the house (although pretty flexible about this if you have friends round for dinner). I'm very open about it and you'll no doubt have questions so please do ask away.

A little bit about the flat: It is located in Salford 5 min walk from regent retail park, JD gym, Sainsburyâs etc. walking distance from town, deansgate and spinningfields  with easy transport links. The flat is a two bed two bath so you will have your own en-suite. There is a patio garden, communal gym and roof top terrace. The flat has a Juliet balcony and comes fully furnished. There is a postal room where all packages go and a reception with a concierge. There is a car park for an extra fee. A little bit about me:I am a 24 year old professional, I work 9-5 during the week. I enjoy cooking often, gym, going out to eat and for drinks. Super clean and I am looking for someone who cleans up after themselves and is super tidy. I am out and about most weekends but I do love the occasional lazy Saturday on the sofa. Hoping to find a flatmate who I can chill with after work and be friends with, not just flatmates.
