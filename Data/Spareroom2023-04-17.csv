2023-04-17,Double room in a 2 bed flat within Hulme,£550 pcm,"The flat:I'm looking for someone to take over a spare double bedroom in a ground floor, 2 bed flat within Hulme. It's a nice and quiet area within a 10 minute walk from Manc city centre. There is one shared bathroom in the property, one off road parking space (my own) but I think there is an option to apply for an on street parking permit within Hulme if you need your own parking. I own a lot of gym equipment which I don't mind sharing and while not in the pictures there's a TV in the living room. No pets are allowed in the flat.The rent might be a little negotiable. It includes internet (Hyperoptic 250mb), electric & water but not council tax (I'm assuming an extra ~£70 a month / Council Tax band C). I have 6 months left on my current contract. After this I'm not sure if the owners are coming back or whether I can extend the contract if I wanted. Either way I'll be living in Manc a few more years so it would be ideal to find someone I could flat share with further to the 6 months if things go well.The room:A pretty decent sized room that comes with a desk and lots of storage. The bed is a pull out but my previous tenant had no issues leaving it out. The current mattress might look thin but is surprisingly comfortable. Myself:I work as a clinical scientist, currently work on site but I will get 2 WFH days later on. I'm a tidy and considerate housemate who enjoys cooking, outdoor trips, gaming, going to gigs, exercise, anything geeky and pubbing.Who I'm looking for:I'm looking for someone who is relatively tidy, pretty relaxed and must be considerate to my work schedule in the week. Bonus if there was an overlap of interests and some social elements to the flat share.

2023-04-17,Peaceful/Quirky place. Big wild garden.,£550 pcm,"Hi, I'm Jake, and I'm looking for somebody nice to share my house. I have a double room that will be available from the 1st of June, but I'm not in a rush. I'm more interested in the finding the right fit.  It's an unusual place and is still partly work in progress. Whilst the house may look a bit rough on the outside it is very nicely renovated on the inside and the room itself would be in beautiful condition.  It's currently occupied by myself and Marina(a postgraduate student in visual anthropology)  I'd describe the vibe as very peaceful and friendly, so might suit a mature student or someone doing PHD. Perhaps someone wanting a place for a year or two rather than to settle longer term. Given the recent massive hike in bills costs, someone with student status would be preferable as it makes the council tax cheaper(Council tax is band C but this is included in the rent, so if I accept a professional person I'll need to increase the rent a little to £585)I work in the performing arts, my time is split between work/tinkering with projects,  home/garden, spending time with my partner in Leeds(she rarely comes here) and more recently I spend a lot of time in Scotland looking after aged parents. So a lot of the time it would just be 2 people in a pretty decent sized house.   The house features a crazy big wild garden out  back.(very much work in progress.... nature is  perhaps doing most of the work here)  We're both sociable and friendly and enjoy preparing and sharing food when time allows but are also quite independent.  It would be nice to have someone who would similarly enjoy a bit of sharing without feeling obliged.  It's important to us to keep a tidy ship so someone who is happy/enthusiastic about keeping things very clean and tidying up as they go would be a good fit. We're neither of us big fans of alcohol consumption/boozy culture, but certainly not prudish and do have the odd glass with food. I'm open to the idea of renting  a room furnished or unfurnished and might also consider short term let with the right person. I may be a little slow replying to messages because I've got a lot on, but If you think you might be a good match, message and tell us a bit about yourself and what you're looking for. Look forward to hearing from you. Cheers.

Back room contains large sofa and large TV/Playstation, which has Sky, BT, Netflix, Amazon Prime and Disney+ available.

Old Trafford and Wharfside also nearby depending which direction / line you need.â¢ Trafford Centre (3rd biggest shopping centre in UK) is 10 min drive away and easy to get to by tram & bus. Manchester Arndale also easy to get to by getting the tram to Market Street.â¢ Big Tesco is a 2 min drive up Chester Rd and Co-op shop 2 min walk. White City retail park is also next to Tesco.â¢ Bridgewater Canal is a great cycling or walking route that takes you all the way through Sale and Altrincham and into Dunham Massey, or up into Castlefield / City centre.â¢ Match days at Old Trafford always bring an exciting atmosphere to the area. Tickets can be expensive/hard to get for popular games but it is definitely something you should experience, especially an evening game. The cricket stadium gets used for England games plus Harry Styles, Red Hot Chilli's and The Killlers played there a few months ago.â¢ Salford Quays is a 15/20 min walk away and has loads of bars & restaurants, shopping centre, cinema, the Lowry Theatre, Imperial War Museum, and MediaCityUK where the BBC and ITV film a lot of their shows. Van Gogh Alive and Lightwaves are based here too.â¢ O2 Victoria Warehouse is 15 min walk away and is a great venue for music events, usually disco/house/techno. The Warehouse Project used to be held here (you canât hear anything from the house).â¢ Choice of 3 nearby gyms available â PureGym Stretford & NRG Gym both 10/15min walk away, PureGym Exchange Quay 20 min walk away.â¢ Overall a popular area going through early gentrification stages yet still quite family orientated. Loads of things to do to keep you happy and entertained.In terms of myself, Iâm a 28 year old male working professional, sometimes in the office sometimes at home, who owns the house. Very keen on travelling and music events, I tend to go out in the evenings quite regularly and spend the weekend in London visiting friends about once a month.

2023-04-17,Double room in 2 bed flat close to city centre,£375 pcm,"Hello! Iâm Georgia and Iâm looking for a new flatmate as mine is sadly moving to India.Iâve been living in this flat for two years now and I love it - itâs cosy and in a great location, a 20 minute walk to the city centre (without paying city centre prices!). The flat itself is a first floor, 2 bedroom 1 bathroom flat in a block of 6 (3 stories high, 2 flats on each floor, shared central stairwell - no lift Iâm afraid). It is council tax band A so we currently pay £131 a month split between two. The flat also has a small balcony that Iâve got 2 chairs and a table on and gets the sun in the afternoon/evening. There is a shared kitchen, bathroom, and living/dining space. And plenty of storage!Your bedroom comes with a double bed+mattress, a lovely big desk with a drawers, a freestanding wardrobe and a built in wardrobe. The rest of the flat is furnished as youâd imagine. Bills usually come to as follows:Gas and electric: £90 a month (although subject to change what with everything going on)Water: £55 a monthCouncil tax: £131 a monthWifi: £25 a month (weâve got hyperoptic fibre optic cables so super fast)Then this is split equally between the two tenants so comes to about £150 each. Plus rent that makes monthly expenditure £525I work from home every day - my job is completely remote and there isnât an office for me to go into so I have a desk in the living room that I work at. My current housemate also works from home (both bedrooms do have desks that we go to for meetings) and itâs great - so Iâm happy for whatever work situations really, work from home, hybrid or fully in the office I really donât mind. A bit about me: I am super clean and tidy! Iâm a vegetarian and would prefer to live in a meat free home. I work for an anti-poverty charity and am quite political (so no tories please lol). I really value having a comfortable and relaxing home, and so weeknights are always quiet. Iâm not a massive drinker but I do like to go for gentle pints down the pub, or out to nice bars with friends at the weekend. I like to keep busy and out of the house a lot (since Iâm here all the time for work!) so most nights Iâm out doing my hobbies or visiting friends - I love to cook and host people for dinner too. I pole dance,  Iâm a big reader, I enjoy creative pursuits like pottery, I love getting out in nature for hikes etc, and Iâm at the Buddhist centre most weeks. Iâve lived in Manchester since I came to uni here in 2017 (minus a year abroad). I am looking for someone to move in who is likeminded and shares interests, so that we can genuinely be friends. But I am also respectful of privacy and giving each other space! I would like someone who values having a clean and relaxing sanctuary kind of home, but also likes to get out and have fun! I would prefer someone who is veggie/vegan, and someone who is thoughtful and considerate of others. Please give me a message if you think this sounds good - Iâm happy to meet up for a drink or a coffee to get to know each other!

So technically you and the other person would share the shower in one of the bathrooms but apart from that you'd have one all to yourself with the toilet and all that (pretty cool isn't it?)There's obviously a shared living room (which btw is decorated differently than in the photo) and a kitchen with all equipment needed. Also, we've got a balcony overlooking the canal :). The view is cute too.  Rent/Bills: Bills are not included in the rent but the broadband is. In total, they come to around £140/150 a month (it can vary slightly monthly due to the electricity but I'm planning to find a provider with lower rates). There's a deposit of £567. You will be signing the agreement with the agency owning the building so you'll probably need to go through all the checks, references etc.About current flatmates:There's two guys (one of them being me lol).  I'd say we're really easy-going people. We're both sociable, clean, and talkative, yet obviously like to spend time in our rooms. Just FYI, for most of the time I work from home. The other guy in a hybrid setting. Personally, I'm into gym, music, photography, podcasts and a few other bits. About you:Just be a decent pers, I guess. If you clean after yourself, like to have a decent convo every now and then, and are relatively easy-going too, that'd be great!If you would like to know anything else or arrange a viewing please get in touch or ask any additional questionsThanks,Mac",Flat share,Castlefield,M15,https://www.spareroom.co.ukhttps://www.spareroom.co.uk/flatshare/flatshare_detail.pl?flatshare_id=16600994&search_id=1212213745&city_id=&flatshare_type=offered&search_results=%2Fflatshare%2F%3Foffset%3D500%26search_id%3D1212213745%26sort_by%3Dby_day%26mode%3Dlist&,Now,11 months,None,Furnished,Yes,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,shared,Yes,No,Yes,Yes,Professional,Yes,21,Males or females,36,,Spareroom

Love exploring what Manchester has to offer, and always happy to have someone come along if you're new to the city!Also, I'm currently studying for a professional qualification alongside work so am very mindful of those who may need to do the same, and would expect the same from anyone planning on moving in.

The locationSet back from Upper Chorlton Road, itâs easy to get into the city centre by bike, bus (no. 86 passes right outside) or tram (10 mins walk to Firswood).

Iâm a freelance event producer, currently working for Meta.Iâd say Iâm laidback and low maintenance but also proactive and like being out and about outdoors - cycling, running, surfing - or indoors - cooking, reading & listening to music.YouIâve done the grimy, house-share thing and this isnât one of those.

2023-04-17,Double room available in apartment in Ancoats,£600 pcm,"Hello! Are you searching for a tranquil room in a beautiful apartment located in the sought-after Ancoats area? I am seeking someone to come and rent this delightful double room in my home. The atmosphere is calm and inviting, perfect for someone who values a peaceful living environment. Not only is the space super comfortable, I also like to keep it clean and tidy. Im looking for someone who also values a fresh and clutter-free space. The room is the smaller of the two, but itâs still a sizable space and comes fully furnished, including a cozy double bed, wardrobe, and a desk plus a handy set of small drawers (if needed, the desk and drawers can be removed). Youâll have access to the main bathroom which is also kept sparkling clean. I have an en-suite so thereâs never any issue with waiting for a shower in the morning. The main bathroom is shared, so I use it for occasional baths and guests use the loo etc. The open-plan living area is a fantastic place to relax and unwind, with plenty of natural light and a relaxing day bed that's even more comfortable than a sofa! I love to drink morning coffee here, watch TV in the evenings and occasionally use this space to work from. When it comes to catching the morning sun, the balcony is your go-to, and the complex is ultra-safe and secure with lovely, respectful neighbors as well. If youâre searching for a clean, tidy, and inviting apartment and a friendly person to live with (whoâs also a good cook), contact me today to book a viewing. A bit about me:I am a vegan, so Iâd be keen to share my home with a like-minded individual who shares my passion for healthy, conscious living. However, if you're a meat-eater, that's okay! As long as you clean up after yourself after cooking and eating, we'll get along just fine. While I value my own space, I'm usually up for a friendly chat and enjoy watching Netflix series together in the evenings. If I'm not relaxing at home, you'll find me exploring the cafes and bars in Ancoats and NQ with my friends. As a yoga enthusiast, I often start my day with a morning session in the living room. Donât worry, the soundproofing in the apartment is pretty good. I'm not much of a drinker and I donât smoke. Iâm looking to live with someone else whoâs not a heavy drinker and is also a non-smoker. Itâs definitely not a party house (large gatherings are prohibited in the complex) but I do enjoy hosting a casual dinner party with friends from time to time. My apartment is my sanctuary, and I'm searching for someone who will respect it as much as I do.Thank you!",Flat share,Ancoats,M4,https://www.spareroom.co.ukhttps://www.spareroom.co.uk/flatshare/flatshare_detail.pl?flatshare_id=16664603&search_id=1212213745&city_id=&flatshare_type=offered&search_results=%2Fflatshare%2F%3Foffset%3D600%26search_id%3D1212213745%26sort_by%3Dby_day%26mode%3Dlist&,06 May 2023,3 months,None,Furnished,,,,Yes,,shared,Yes,No,No,No,Professional,Yes,28,Males or females,50,Yes,Spareroom

","Hi there, Pls. Read my advert first before messaging.Iâm a live in landlord. Next available room is June 6, 2023. Advertise only:The single room plus private bathroom: Rent plus bills and Council tax can reach up to £600 plus per month per person. The private bathroom is at ground floor( shower, toilet, sink) with a key. Preferred lodgers are âClean, quiet and niceâ. No working from home 4 days a week. You should be out and not inside the house 24 hours a day. Location is close to the Universities, City centre, Plattfields park and amenities.The  bills are shared into 4 even if you are the only lodger and if you pay Council tax, pay a 1/4 share. I have an extension built, currently decorating stage.Put the date: start and end of stay if you are interested. A character and financial references are required.Description: The house is in a well located nicely furnished/decorated 3 bed semi with new 2 storey extension. Allocated parking available for 2-3 cars. The house is located just south of Plattfields park on a quiet cul de sac. It's modern and thereâs a combined  room for kitchen /diner ( no lounge area) . A locked storage for bikes.     Close to UoM and MMU universities.  27 minutes walk to Swamy Plab Academy. Near Sainsbury, Aldi etc.  and shops with exotic fruits and vegetables.

Further walk, bus Stops to ride reaching within few minutes to Levenshulme, Oxford road, City Centre, Didsbury, Trafford Centre and Manchester Airport.If you are looking for long term rent, contracts can be renewed.   The rate is for single occupancy per room. Therefore, not too much baggage as thereâs not a lot of room for a modern house. Happy to share my basic kitchen stuff or other basic house appliances. But you need to buy items you preferred as my stuff are basics only.Itâs my holiday house with the right insurance for lodgers. I stay in the same house with the lodgers.     Room rents are for single occupancy only.  Not interested on accepting partners, couples using the room. Not for that kind of rental.     A day rent  can be negotiable but £30/day per person. Daily, preferably weekly or can be longer rent. I preferred  longer rental if there are plenty of applicants to choose from.     I require  holding deposit (£100) if booking is more than a weekâs wait. On the moving date, advance payment of a rent and completion of full deposit is required ( holding deposit is part of deposit). A WhatsApp chat will help you too to know my area and people living in the house including me before viewing.I look for a nice person, no drugs, no binge drinker, no criminal records and happy to tidy after themselves. We wash and put away clean dishes and not leave by the sink. This is not a party house. Best to mention all these rules to save your time. All appliances, windows, doors are closed when you leave the room .Previous lodgers were exchange student âERASMUS programâ, masters and PHD students. Currently, working professionals.  No Council tax .I will get back to you ASAP.The current kitchen and bathroom on the picture are for sharing. Thereâs no shared living room as the living room is currently made to a second kitchen for my use.Guide only: quiet at times (respect a regular working hours of 9-5 pm, therefore the house is ready to calm at 10 pm for people who work early morning). Friday to Saturday evening is fine for relax living.If you are extending rent, price may change to lower rent but we have to share bills.Guide of current usage during March 2023 Monthly bills divided by 4 person= gas and electric ( £85), Council tax- £40, Wifi - £7, water- £12.5 per person.

2023-04-17,Professional Pet Friendly Penthouse Great Location,£850 pcm,"Hey everyone, due to some changes at work I need to move and hoping to find someone to take over the last month of the lease. The contract is being renegotiated for June onwards if you wished to stay.The flat is on the 16th floor penthouse right smack in between Manchester and Salford. Manchester Victoria is 15 min walk away and Uni of Salford is 5 mins (and very visible from the views from our windows on the 16th floor).There are two rooms up for grabs. Mine, which has an ensuite included (currently occupied by yours truly) and another room without the ensuite, both available from May 1st.The rent is what it currently works out at with all the bills included and split evenly including council tax.. With the ensuite being an extra £50 pcm. A parking space is available at the building with an additional cost or there is on street parking. I'm sorry I have no idea how much, I think it's somewhere around an extra £100 a month.You'll be living with Nicole for the month of May, who honestly has kept me sane. She handles all the bills and everything to do with the flat. I (and you would) just give her the money each month and she takes care of everything. She is extremely clean, often cleaning the whole flat just because she enjoys it (I could never!) but she is in no way pushy about being clean.There are two dogs at the flat, owned by Nicole. I honestly love them and am very sad to be saying goodbye. Nicole takes care of them completely, the only thing I do is let them out to the balcony to go bathroom every once in a while.1) Chase the Husky is adorable and a huge cuddle monster. He is extremely gentle and calm and quiet, I often forget he is home. He's a great boyo.2) Chica is the Shiba. She's very affectionate and loves to present you with toys in the morning. She loves to play tug and trying to catch laser lights and shadows (be careful with your shoes, there is a shoe rack).On top of the ensuite and main bathroom on the upper floor with the rooms there is a third bathroom on the lower floor. Essentially you could all have a bathroom each if you wanted.There is a gym on site. This is included in the rent.Get in touch!

All rooms are big, including the bathroom which you will be sharing with just one other person. The flat has three bedrooms in total and I'm the live in owner. There is a very large open plan lounge/kitchen/diner. The kitchen is well equipped with quality appliances and any cooking utensils you might need. The flat is clean, quiet and comfortable but the buzz of Ancoats and the Northern Quarter are on your doorstep. As there is so much space we don't get under each others feet and I have provided a fridge and freezer just for lodgers so you'd only be sharing those with one other person. The New Islington tram stop is right outside the development.The bedrooms each have a double bed and quality furniture. Bedding and towels plus a tv are provided should you need them.  This is a quiet flat. We are both private but friendly. If your work means you are getting up very early or getting home very late then this flat is not suitable.Short term two to four months preferred  but will consider longer term. The rent is payable monthly in advance with all utility bills, council tax, broadband and TV licence included. The rent is £675 per calendar month including all bills except if you work from home.. The refundable deposit is £675. There is no parking available with the flat but there may be free on street parking or pay parking nearby. If you do not work from home or are regularly away from home, and therefore not using as much energy, I am willing to negotiate on the rent. I'm into languages, particularly French and Spanish. I've travelled all over the world except for South America which is definitely on my list. I love to cook and I think I'm a pretty good cook and baker. I love to watch Gogglebox and documentaries. My current lodger is a male in his twenties. Weâre both private but friendly.

I just bought the flat & it's my first ever non-rented home, so still settling in.It more or less furnished as you can see from the pics (proud to say it's mostly Freecycle & Marketplace gems!), but there may be 1 or 2 things needed still that I'm acquiring as I go.  The room to rent is furnished & fully ready to live in, but equally if you had some furniture you needed to store in there I'm sure we could move things around to make it work, or elsewhere in the flat too.The flat is 2 bright & spacious double bedrooms,  a separate bathroom, then a spacious and again bright living room with a galley kitchen coming off it.  It's in a block that is opposite Alexandra Park and while half the block faces the park, my flat faces the car park haha.  That's actually great though as the sun sets on that side, so from the early afternoon until sunset it's flooded with light, and the light isn't waking you up in the morning.  Most windows face onto the car park, but 1 faces towards the park, meaning you can work or eat at the table and see into the park.The flat is filled with plants, and tbh I've spent more on them than the furniture combined!  There's a few in the room for rent, and of course you can bring any more alongside the rest of your belongings! If you're a cyclist you could bring this into the building and keep it outside the flat door, or equally you could keep it in the bedroom.  There are bike rails in the car park if you choose to take that risk (I don't!).The price is currently set for an individual, but if you're a couple drop me a message and we can have a chat about what it would be!

2023-04-17,"Ensuite, Double BedRoom avaialble in a shared flat",£500 pcm,"Hi everyone. I currently stay in Duet, Salford Quays, Manchester and having to leave very soon due to personal reasons. I am looking for someone to take over my tenancy from the 20th of April (ideally) or later. It's a two bedroom flat, with one room occupied by my friends (couple) and I have a double bedroom, ensuite with me. We share the kitchen and living room, but have our own separate toilets/bathrooms. The flat is fully furnished and I am happy to leave the  study table I bought. The flat is in is a lovely building (Duet) having an on site gym, conference room, garden/skydeck, 24 hour concierge and a resident lounge with free coffee. We also have a social every Friday (where free drinks are provided for residents to socialise); Wellness Wednesdays (Free Yoga, HIIT, Strength Training Sessions); pet socials and other events regularly. The building has a tram and bus station right as you step outside (with trams to the city centre taking 20 mins) and; Mediacity with host of pubs, cafes, restaurants and a Sainsbury's at a walking distance. You also get the waterfront right behind the building and a lovely walking path besides the canal to walk, jog etc. My contract is until October 12th 2023 and you'll have a 6 months contract remaining from the 12th of April (the rent due date is the 12th of every month, rent paid in advance for the next month). But if you're looking for sometime later, we can work something out. We are looking for a professional, because for students you ideally need a guarantor (but feel free to reach out and we can see if something can be done about it). We have a very chilled, respectful vibe in the flat, and although we like hanging out together, we are very mindful of each other's privacy. Would like to find someone who enjoys as such. Bills (council tax, heating, gas) come to around 100-150 pounds per person, per month (broadband included in rent), so you are looking at around 600 - 650 pounds per month including rent. PS: Cooking non-vegetarian food in the house is an issue, since my current flatmates are religiously vegetarian. Of course, eating anything in your room is fine, but if not being able to cook non-vegetarian food is a deal breaker, I am really sorry. If you'd be interested, please let me know and we can arrange to meet/have a viewing for you. Meanwhile you can check the building social media.",Flat share,Salford Quays,M50,https://www.spareroom.co.ukhttps://www.spareroom.co.uk/flatshare/flatshare_detail.pl?flatshare_id=16656319&search_id=1212213745&city_id=&flatshare_type=offered&search_results=%2Fflatshare%2F%3Foffset%3D820%26search_id%3D1212213745%26sort_by%3Dby_day%26mode%3Dlist&,Now,None,6 months,Furnished,Yes,,Yes,,Yes,shared,Yes,No,Yes,Yes,Professional,Yes,21,Males or females,,Yes,Spareroom

2023-04-17,Small cheap double bed room in Ancoats,£250 pcm,"Hello!So I've decided to rent out my second bedroom and I'm only asking for £250 per month all inclusive.The reason for this is that, whilst the bedroom has a double bed and desk, it is fairly small and also about half the wardrobe is being used for storing clothes so it doesn't have a lot of room left. There are however other storage areas in the flat that you could use.Given that my bedroom as an en suite bathroom, the main bathroom would be used just by yourself.The flat has a really nice living room with a big TV, Netflix, Amazon Prime etc and a huge private terrace which is lovely in the summer :)The other reason why I've decided to ask for such a low rent is that I spend most of the time in the living room, WFH but also making electronic music in the evenings, although i mainly use headphones so you can still chill on the sofa and watch TV.I work 3 days a week nigt shifts somewhere else however so you would have the flat for yourself 3 nights a week.I am flexible in terms of the duration of the share, anywhere between 1 to 4 months but could also extend this potentially..

2023-04-17,Cosy flat in New Islington,£750 pcm,"I'm looking to rent out the spare room in my 2 bed flat in New IslingtonI'm a 38 year old gay man from London originally. I've worked in Sales and Account Management for some time but I'm currently working in a book shop whilst I suss out my next career move. Into all kinds of stuff (see list). I'm super respectful of personal space (I defo need my own at times) but I also love to get to know people and have a laugh. Always up for a good TV show or film and love to be out and about experiencing Manchester and the surrounding areas. It's rare that I do an all day fester on the sofa nowadays. I'm clean and tidy but I'm not anal. The place is lived in rather than show home.The flat is well furnished (your bedroom will need some stuff but I'd like to suss out your requirements before I purchase anything). It's a spacious double with an en-suite and lots of natural light overlooking the canal. The flat is new and is well finished and well sound proofed.The building has a 24 hour concierge, a residents terrace and communal room. It's a 2 min walk to New Islington tram stop (direct trams to Piccadilly, Deansgate and Media City) and right on New Islington Marina. Aldi and Co-op are a 5/10 min walk and both Ancoats and the Northern Quarter are walkable where there is brilliant good, shopping and nightlife.I'm ultimately looking for someone easy going, friendly and respectful. I'm the live in landlord but I very much want you to feel like this is your home. I want an environment where we are comfortable sharing about our days whilst we unwind and eat/watch TV. Hopefully the odd outing and games night too. Sorry gays but for personal reasons I'm currently only open to females and straight men. It will just be me and you so the personality match is very important.An important thing to know about me is that I'm a recovering addict and completely sober. My party days are behind me and as a result I sadly can't have booze in the house (although pretty flexible about this if you have friends round for dinner). I'm very open about it and you'll no doubt have questions so please do ask away. It's important that we are both OK and comfortable with the boundaries before we commit to anything.Hope to hear from you.

2023-04-17,Single room to rent in lovely spacious house,£660 pcm,"Hey everyone!Weâre looking for someone to move into the cozy single bedroom on the upper floor of the house. Weâre a five-person house and we enjoy hanging out together when our schedules align but weâre still very respectful of each otherâs space. Weâd love to find a new housemate who is looking for more than a room to rent but also a home to share. We try to bring a homely vibe to the house and make it into our own safe space.About the House/Room:We have a 5 bedroom house with a spacious kitchen and lounge. The garden and decking provide us with a lovely outdoor space to chill out and eat dinner when the weatherâs warm. The lawn has seen better days but we have grand plans to spruce it up and get it rejuvenated by the summer. Between an understairs cupboard, attic space and the upstairs landing we have plenty of storage space in the house. We also have a small spare room that we use as a space to hang laundry or for visitors to stay in when we have guests.When it comes to cleaning, weâre all pretty good with pitching in and keeping the house tidy. We feel the key is just communicating with each other about what needs doing and helping out when we can.The room is a nice size and very cozy and is in a quiet part of the house. Itâs at the back of the house so you donât hear any noise from the road. The radiatorâs great and keeps the room nice and warm in the winter and with such a big window you can get a good breeze in the summer. All the furniture (single bed, shelves, built-in closet) is staying but youâre welcome to bring your own in or bring a double bed since it will definitely fit one.About the Area:Weâre less than a 15 minute walk from Willesden Junction station which has great overground links and is on the Bakerloo line. There are also great bus links to Euston, Notting Hill and Shepherdâs Bush. Thereâs a Tesco superstore about a 5 minute walk away as well as a wide variety of shops and takeaway places. Weâre also very close to a couple of cute cafes and pubs. Overall itâs a lovely area and our street feels very safe, being a 2 minute walk from a really nice park ainât too bad either, especially in Summer!About Us:So the four of us youâd be joining are Aggy, Ishy, Louise and Ines. Aggy is a full-time dog carer which means we quite often have some furry friends stay with us for a day or two which is fun but never too much as sheâs super respectful about caring for animals in our shared space. Sheâs also into music, photography, reading and crying of laughterâ¦ and come to mention it, just crying in general!Ishy is our resident musician and an incredibly talented fella. He currently works in a hotel near Kingâs Cross, is a really chilled out, funny person and weâre all pretty sure he has a soundboard in his head.Louise is super thoughtful, kind and relaxed. She loves cooking, gardening and works at a popular music venue.Ines is our newest housemate and sheâs a real kind soul, respectful and an all-round delight. We like to have dinner or movie nights together on occasion, but as mentioned before, we donât put pressure on ourselves to hang out a lot as we all have fairly different working schedules. Overall, weâre just very respectful and easy-going people and weâre proud that weâve managed to build such a wholesome living arrangement and would love to find someone whoâs excited to join the house!One last thing! Our landlord is actually selling the house in November so the new tenant will only be able to stay for about 6 months, so the room may be best suited for someone whoâs looking to find their feet in London.*pics of the room to follow*Move in date can be negotiable to make it earlier at no extra cost!

2023-04-17,"EN-SUITE Double Room in East Village, Olympic park","£1,144 pcm","I'm moving in with my boyfriend, so I'm looking for someone who's interested in my double EN-SUITE room in a beautiful, spacious 3-bedroom flat in East Village. My tenancy lasts until the end of March 2025, but tenants can switch in and out of the flat after three months. The new tenant must move in on the 26th of a month as that's our rental due date, so the new move-in date could be either May 26th or June 26th (I'm flexible).The flat: The room comes fully furnished, complete with a double bed and built-in wardrobes, bedside tables, and a chest of drawers (plenty of storage space!!). The room is high-spec, modern, with underfloor heating and a lovely en-suite with a high-pressure shower. We use one room as a spare room/study which is fantastic if you WFH or want to have friends over; the other room belongs to my friends Sophia and Dan, who are a couple. The household: Sophia and Dan are young professionals who are great to live with. It's a chill, tidy household. You can't be allergic to cats because Sophia and Dan have two very sweet kitties. They are quiet and friendly cats who are fully cared for, and who love a pet!The area: This lovely three-bed is in East Village, Stratford, about an 8-minute walk from Stratford Underground Station (Jubilee, Central, Overground, Elizabeth and DLR lines!) and 5 minutes from Stratford International (with HS1 and DLR!). It has great access and is around a 6-minute walk from Westfields Shopping Centre and the Olympic Park for beautiful walks.Other details: The room is £1140pcm excluding bills, which are usually around £100pcm. Unfortunately, moving in is an affordability criterion, so youâll need to be earning at least 30 x rent (so £34200) or half that if youâre renting as a couple. (I think you can potentially have a guarantor though).Please drop me a message if you're interested!

No smokers please. Shared house bills outlined below.I am actually so much fun, but have had to make this ad really direct and it might come across a bit harsh (so sorry about that!). There are many people messaging wasting our time. We decided we needed to be quite direct so we only receive messages from people who are looking for the same things in a houseshare as us :) Thanks for understanding!You are living with 1 well educated, professional couple (in their late 30's) & 1 academic researcher working for a professor at London School of Economics (in her late 20's). We all value our own private space and we give you yours too. We are warm and welcoming people. We love maintaining a positive energy in the house. We'd like to live with someone who is not expecting to hang out regularly with their housemates. We all have busy lives and want to live with someone who, like us, does their own thing. But of course, we are all cordial and friendly when we greet eachother in passing, or have chats in the communal areas!This is a no smoking & no vaping apartment so please do not apply if you smoke/vape. Please only apply if you value a tranquil, home environment. We want to live with a person who keeps regular hours (instead of coming home at 3am every night). Your friends/family are welcome, but we prefer to live with someone who is not bringing strangers back to the apartment regularly. Hopefully this suits you! We are fully Covid vaccinated and expect our flatmate to be also :)About the room:The room comes fully furnished with a double bed & new mattress. You will need to bring your own pillows, sheets & bed clothes for the bed (this is the norm in London). There is plenty of storage â a wardrobe, seperate built in wardrobe, chest of drawers, shelving. You have a solid work desk with additional storage built into it, and an ergonomic (back supporting) chair in your room, for setting up your work station or laptop. All of that furniture is included! Your bedroom get lots of natural light. The sunset also comes in, lighting it up magically every evening.Whatâs included:There is equal storage space allocated for you in the kitchen cupboards, refrigerator and freezer. Plenty of space for 1 person! The kitchen is fully kitted out with all crockery, cooking appliances and utensils you need for eating, drinking, cooking. You are welcome to bring your own also.Breakdown of fees:Room price is £820. All bills & household extras on top of that are £100. This includes: gas, electricity, water and high-speed fibre optic broadband, bins, recycling, council tax. Even toilet roll & shared cleaning products! You dont need to buy anything for the house or communal areas. If we itemised it you would be paying more, but because we dont have the time to split every single bill with a fine tooth comb 4 ways every month, it is easier for us to give you a substantially reduced rate overall and it always remains the same amount. Even though household bills are increasing alarmingly throughout the UK, we do not vary what we charge you - it is always only £100 per month. So the full amount you pay is £920. We also take care of all maintenance and upgrades of the communal areas of the apartment included in that too! There are no other charges.On top of that, you have use of our washing machine, tumble dryer, ironing board, iron, hairdryer. Everything you need is provided! There is no TV, but there is high speed internet if you wish to watch things on your laptop.About the apartment:It's quiet, secure, clean & get's plenty of natural light from the large windows throughout. It's a 3 bedroom apartment split over 2 levels. This is a great apartment and all bedrooms are really spacious, so the first to view will want to move in! The bedroom in the video is NOT your room. We included the video to give you a feel for the apartment layout in communal areas. The photos attached show your bedroom! It is the largest bedroom in the apartment. There is a fully equipped kitchen / dining area that has a built in dining booth downstairs. There is no communal livingroom with couches. There are 2 toilets and 1 bathtub in the apartment (with hot power shower). Both bathrooms are tiled beautifully recently and are kept really clean. All bedrooms have new high grade anti-bacterial carpets. Locks on the bedroom doors add to the security for you. You can see the skyscrapers of Canary wharf as you walk along the entrance balcony at the front of the apartment! Beautiful view when lit up in the evening.We have really nice British families as neighbours either side of us who have been here years, so it is a lovely safe & quiet location to be in. Walking home at night is very safe on well lit wide streets. I am a girl, do it regularly alone, and have for a few years now, and have always felt safe. We are only a 4 minute walk down 1 straight street from Mile End tube station!Location:Mile End is one of the best places to be located in London as it is so central and a great transport hub. The tube station is a 4 minute walk along a safe, flat road from my apartment. It has so many public transport routes going through it, 3 tube lines with trains every 60 seconds, and 4 bus routes outside taking you to Tower Bridge, Piccadilly or Stratford Westfield (it is 1 stop away & the biggest shopping centre in Europe). Making it very convenient to get all around the city fast! Directly behind my apartment are another 3 bus routes that service Canary Wharf, Hackney and Dalston. You can go in every direction easily on public transport from my place. The easy access to every area is why I chose this exact location to live in!The apartment is located in between 3 green areas. So the air is the cleanest & pure in the city. The pretty Regents Canal river runs behind the apartment block & is lovely to walk along in the early evening. Walk north along the canal and you reach Victoria Park in 8 minutes with great coffee spots and bakeries all week, then there's a fab Farmers Market in the park every Sunday. My apartment is honestly a dream location! There are lots of independent shops, micro breweries in the area (Crate, Howling Hops, Old St Brewery) and farmers markets happening on the weekend. Columbia Road Flower Market (Sunday) has lots of quirky independent shops too, then Broadway Market (Saturday) packed with the best British produce, live musicians and hot food stalls.Mile End stadium and gym is across the road, a 30 second walk from the apartment. It has a really cheap, well equipped gym & swimming pool. Prices start at £30 per month to join, itâs great & the cheapest in the city. £4 to use the sauna without being a member and £6 to swim in their Olympic sized pool!Transport links:Tube (from Mile End station): Central line, District line, Hammersmith & City line. Bus routes 277, D6, D7, 205, 25.1 tube stop, 60 seconds travel time from Mile End (Whitechapel/Stratford tube stations): Overground line, Crossrail line, DLR line, Jubilee line, Elizabeth line.Distance by tube from apartment: Stratford Westfield Shopping Centre (biggest in Europe), 2 minutes. Bethnal Green, 3 minutes. Bank station, 8 minutes. Canary Wharf, 8 minutes. Oxford Circus 16 minutes. London Bridge & Borough Market 16 minutes. Tower of London, 6 minutes. Hammersmith, 45 minutes.About us:We are a well educated, friendly couple, in our 30âs. White, British. We have a lovely academic researcher living with us. She is thoughtful, respectful of personal space and super polite. She is British with Chinese heritage. We are very welcoming and full of positive energy. We are your housemates! We are clean, tidy, quiet when moving about the apartment. Just generally, considerate & respectful people. We are looking for someone normal & kind, who genuinely appreciates a positive home environment. Please do not apply if you are a really untidy person or lead a chaotic life of late nights. Please only apply if you are respectful in keeping the communal areas in decent shape, just as we do. We are really relaxed, but do enjoy living in a clean house. So it's important the person moving in values tidiness too! We'd like it if you are in fulltime employment and you have some sort of routine to your week. The odd late night is fine, but we don't want to live with someone who comes in at 3am, bringing strangers back. All 3 of us have fulltime jobs with a pretty regular weekday routine. So I just need to say that in advance. About you:We are looking for a professional from any industry sector who leaves the apartment to go to work a few days a week, not someone who works from home fulltime. Someone who has a happy demeanour. Someone who is considerate of other people they live with and happy to keep the communal areas respectfully tidy after using them, for the benefit of everyone in the house. We all keep it really spotless in the communal areas, so that it's nice for everyone to use. This apartment is not suitable for a smoker/vaper. We want to live with people who appreciate a quiet, calm, safe home where they know who is coming and going from the apartment. So our place is not suitable for a party person who plans social gatherings or bringing strangers/random people back regularly. For your piece of mind, we don't bring friends or strangers to the apartment, maybe just family who visit once or twice a year, for lunch and a park walk.Please get in touch to arrange a viewing. We'd love to hear from you! Only applicants providing a short description (some info) about themselves will be considered. Many thanks!

2023-04-17,"Fun, friendly, newly renovated penthouse",£900 pcm,"Looking for two new girls to join me in this freshly renovated, split level, penthouse home- 30 minutes from Soho!Sadly both my current roomies are having to move for work! Iâm Lilian, a young professional working in fashion who is looking for someone chatty and fun, who loves a cuppa/glass of wine and a catch-up after work (yes thatâs a mini wine cellar in the kitchen floor!)Weâre right on the brand new Elizabeth line (itâs beaut!) it takes 20 mins to Tottenham Court Road, 8 mins to Canary Wharf, 15 mins to Liverpool Street. We also have the DLR (20 mins to Stratford, 28 mins to Bank) and overground (22 mins to London Bridge). These are all under 10 minutes walk away. Weâre the first to live here since itâs been completely renovated and we absolutely love it! I like working out, wine, travel and the house is kept VERY clean and tidy - great if you're also someone who loves to live in a super clean, always tidy, minimalist, modern home (eg. we even put the toaster away in the cupboard when not in use). I occasionally work from home so am looking for someone who also doesnât work from home much more than 2 days a week (to keep fair use of the communal areas). Female only, sorry no students and no couples.The bathroom will usually only be shared between yourself and one other, there is also a separate WC upstairs. We have a weekly cleaner and I also keep all the toilet rolls, kitchen rolls, washing up liquid, bin bags, hand soaps, cleaning products, air fresheners etc stocked at no extra cost- so gone are the days of arguing over who buys the toilet rolls! Thereâs high speed wifi across two channels. A Co-op two minutes walk away and Tesco megastore 7 mins walk away. Netflix, Amazon prime, Disney plus and Spotify logged in on the TV for your use. The bed is a double ottoman with under bed storage and comes with four pillows, double duvet and two sets of bedsheets. Matching towels are also made available for your use.Shoot me a message and we can organise a quick no pressure FaceTime to see how we get on!  looking forward to hearing from you and speaking soon <3L xx",Flat share,London SE18,SE18,https://www.spareroom.co.uk/flatshare/flatshare_detail.pl?flatshare_id=16676213&search_id=1212446191&city_id=&flatshare_type=offered&search_results=%2Fflatshare%2F%3Foffset%3D90%26search_id%3D1212446191%26sort_by%3Dby_day%26mode%3Dlist&,24 Apr 2023,9 months,None,Furnished,Yes,No,No,Yes,No,shared,Yes,No,No,No,Professional,Yes,25,Female preferred,35,Yes,Spareroom

2023-04-17,Large loft room available in Bermondsey!,"£1,000 pcm","Hi! My flatmate has had to move back home overseas, and has left me high and dry! I need someone to take her room :) The nitty gritty.. You:Looking for someone with a similar lifestyle, so working professional in their mid twenties preferably - otherwise all are welcome. Some common interests are always a bonus! Couples are welcome too, the rent would increase to 1200. The nasties:You will be taking over my old flatmate's role in the tenancy, which is a 2 year contract that is about 5 months in. Rent is 1000 per month, and you will pay her share of the deposit back to her and your name will be switched on the deposit scheme (and tenancy) by the agents. The deposit was 5 weeks rent. You will need to pass referencing and meet affordability too (through the agents) - or pay 6 months in advance if you don't meet it. Electricity has been about 140pm total, but that is over a rough winter. Plus there is no gas, so that's one less bill. Wifi is 10 ea per month. It is unlimited and pretty fast. The location: The house is in council band C. It is in a small quiet cul-de-sac in Bermondsey, less than a 5 minute walk to the Tesco superstore. In terms of amenities, there are a bunch of local shops and restaurants down the road, there's also an argos! Burgess Park is around the corner, and the Bermondsey beer mile isn't far either. 15-20 min walk to Bermondsey station, or a 5 minute walk to a bus stop with a bunch of buses that will take you anywhere (21, 53, 63, 168, 172, 363, 413, 453 etc.). The room/house: The house is a 2-bed maisonette, on the 2nd/top storey with a private entrance and a very small front courtyard. The place came unfurnished - but we have furnished it a bit! This has been a gradual process and I'm hoping someone will help me finish the job! It is super warm, everything is double glazed. Your room is on the third floor/loft (second floor of the flat). It has a big skylight that actually gets a lot of sun (and opens fully). It is pretty spacious and fits a queen bed and draws and a desk etc with plenty of room left over. It also has a big built in wardrobe. The house has a couple of really big cupboards around for storage too.My old flatmate is wanting to sell her stuff in the pictures - the mirror (30), clothes rack (15), mattress (100) chest/drawers (40) and a few other items too. The lounge has lots of natural light and a nice high ceiling, it's big enough for all the usual stuff, plus all the existing furniture is staying. Bathroom typical stuff, with a washer. Kitchen the same, a bit small but effective. Missing a microwave and a few things I haven't bought yet - but getting there! Oven+Hob, fridge, freezer, toaster, kettle etc. are all there. Me:My name is Oscar, I am 25, from New Zealand and have been living in London for almost two years. I am working full time in architecture in Shoreditch and am in the office three days a week usually, and like to work Mondays and Fridays at home when possible (but this changes some weeks). I like to play guitar, and am usually pretty quiet during the week, (apart from when there are work drinks). In the weekend I like to get out and about, galleries, markets, parks etc. and in the evening usually end up having some drinks with friends. If you made it this far and are interested - please send me a message with a bit of info about yourself! Viewings will be over the next week.Cheers :)",Flat share,Bermondsey,SE1,https://www.spareroom.co.uk/flatshare/flatshare_detail.pl?flatshare_id=16676091&search_id=1212446191&city_id=&flatshare_type=offered&search_results=%2Fflatshare%2F%3Foffset%3D120%26search_id%3D1212446191%26sort_by%3Dby_day%26mode%3Dlist&,30 Apr 2023,6 months,None,Furnished,No,No,No,No,No,shared,No,Yes,No,No,Professional,Yes,23,Males or females,30,,Spareroom

About the tenants:We are two Jack's (you don't also have to be called Jack to live here!), and are 27 and 28 years old. We are outgoing and sociable, heavily into our sports (one footballer and one rugby player) and always up for going for a pint. We are looking for someone of similar calibre who enjoys socialising/sport etc. and will bring a good energy to the flat.

The bedroom comes furnished as photographed and has a tiny balcony accessible through your bedroom door that you will have sole use of. Beautiful sunset views!

Thank you, I've worked very hard on it. It would help me respond to you if you included in your application:- your age, gender and employment status;- the room you're applying for and your move-in date;- evidence that you have read the listing thoroughly.If you have a question, please check the ad as it's likely you'll find your answer there =)Due to large volumes of responses, I'm sorry I wonât be able to respond to unqualified applicants. No studentsNo couplesWorking professionals onlyNo people under the age of 24I am ideally looking for a female tenantHi there, Iâm looking for a mature and responsible adult to share my beautiful home as a lodger.

Itâs ideal for someone who likes a clean & tidy space and takes pride in maintaining their environment. I pay a housekeeper to visit every week to make our lives easier. Sheâs a key member of the household and we respect her highly! Itâll be possible to pay her for ironing or other similar services if required. Smoking is permitted on the balconies, although we try to keep this to a minimum. If youâre a heavy tobacco smoker you may be asked to take it outside the apartment. The neighbours are kind and respectful, and I maintain a great relationship with them. BEDROOMSBedroom 1 NOT CURRENTLY AVAILABLEThis is my personal bedroom, available intermittently for short periods while I travel. Itâs a luxurious space to relax in! My belongings will remain there while Iâm away. Women only, no couples. The room has a super-kingsize bed with orthopaedic mattress. It has blackout blinds and linen curtains that let beautiful light through in the mornings whilst maintaining privacy. I've added a number of cool features including some incredible mood lighting to make the room a magical and relaxing space.Bedroom 2:NOT CURRENTLY AVAILABLEThis room includes a desk, deep wardrobe with drawers, and a bedside table. The comfy double bed has an orthopaedic mattress and lifts up to reveal plenty more storage. The room also has blackout blinds. There's a large balcony adjacent, which is available for you to rent privately if you wish, giving you an entire ""wing"" of the flat to yourself. Price on request. Bedroom 3 AVAILABLE - flexible datesThis room offers a small wardrobe, a large amount of storage under the double bed, and the same high quality mattress and blackout blinds as in the other bedrooms. If you have a lot of belongings or need to work from home, this room wonât be suitable for you.BathroomThere is one large shared bathroom, and I can offer you a shelf in the cupboard for storage. LOCATIONWe're in Zone 1 and it's very accessible to the city.  - 1 minute walk from bus links into Central London  - 10min cycle or 10min bus to Elephant and Castle Station  - 7min cycle or 22min walk to Bermondsey Station - 14min cycle or 15min bus to London Bridge station - 2min cycle from Quietway 1FOODOur closest supermarket is a 1min walk, plus you can find other supermarkets including Tesco, Lidl and Iceland around 8-15mins walking distance from the property. Marks and Sparks is also a short cycle away. For street food, London's famous Borough Market and Maltby Street Market are nearby, and St James Market (a local secret!) is even closer. We have plenty of restaurants and shops around, and lots of options on Deliveroo and UberEats. OUTDOOR SPACESRoof terrace with sunrise views of Canary WharfGarden2x balconies in flatSouthwark's largest park, Burgess Park, is a 5min walk away, and Southwark Park itself is an 18min walk. There are also a number of smaller green spaces nearby. PARKINGThere's a gated car park with high security indoor bicycle and motorcycle storage behind a coded door under CCTV. There may be a car parking space available for hire from one of our neighbours on request, but I can't guarantee this. WORKING FROM HOMEThere's high speed broadband, great mobile signal, and we get fantastic natural lighting during the day - perfect for video calls and filming.Bedroom 3 is not available for those who need to work from home. PEOPLEIâm a Life Coach and Personal Trainer of 12 years, and also run a dog training business amongst other things. There may be the opportunity to work out together, enjoy the presence of animals, and engage in an atmosphere of personal growth and healing. I cook delicious healthy food, and love to share that with others. From time to time I may offer you a meal. Weâre open-minded & non-judgemental in our attitudes, and definitely not opposed to recreational alcohol consumption etc. When family & children visit the property itâs important we keep things PG. I would prefer if you didnât bring guests into my home, but trusted guests may be welcome on request and within reasonable limits. It wonât be possible to bring back people you just met eg on a night out. Safety and security are paramount. Communication is key and we nurture a culture of respect and non-judgement. This household is LGBQT+ friendly, anti-sexist and anti-racist. LIFESTYLEThere are a lot of perks to living here, and the guideline is to leave the space as you found it. We donât need perfection, and you wonât be subject to any unrealistic expectations. As a dancer, you might find me playing music or practising choreography. I use the main space for client calls and online PT sessions a few times a week. From time to time I rent out my personal room for short periods while Iâm away to help pay for my travel, and my housekeeper manages things while I'm away. Home is a place to recharge, and 90% of the time things are extremely peaceful here. Other times we board dogs, host dinner parties, and do fun activities. I personally prefer a mix of intellectually stimulating conversation and plenty of alone time to decompress from the social nature of my work. If this sounds like a good fit, I'd love to hear from you! Kindly note that weâll need to have a phone call before viewing. Warm regards,MelodyBONUS SECTIONThank you for reading this far! Please see below for a description of the *ideal* applicant, who will receive priority consideration. For you, I would be over the moon to be flexible on age, gender, and employment criteria. The ideal person would be able to not just maintain good standards of cleanliness, but take an active role in the household.They would be established in their business or career, come with a professional and personal network to complement mine, and be in a position to reciprocate the benefits that come from living with a PT, Nutritionist, Wellness and Life Coach with 12 years of business and entrepreneurship experience. The ideal flatmate would have a great skill set with dogs, including how to treat them with respect. They would make it possible for me to have a dog of my own, which - alongside enjoying a professionally trained dog - would include supporting in the training and care of the animal.The ideal applicant understands that we are culturalised into misogyny, racism, homophobia etc. and would be working on their own beliefs and behaviours to avoid bringing this home. From a selfish standpoint, misogyny is particularly problematic for me.I deeply appreciate people with excellent communication skills, eg those who are able to set & receive healthy boundaries with kindness and grace. I love intellectual, philosophical & thoughtful convo, and don't really engage in gossip or celeb culture. Most of the time I prefer to be introverted at home due to the social nature of my work and the emotional loads to decompress from. You don't need to be like me at all (we love diversity), but a personality type to complement this would be ideal. These are not necessities, simply the *ideal*, and the only things it will be possible to flex on my basic age, gender and employment criteria for.

2023-04-17,Double bedroom in Nine Elms,£828 pcm,"Sarah, Sam, Emily and I represent four semi-functioning humans living in a 5 bed in Nine Elms/Battersea. Weâve been living in the property close to a year and are looking for a new housemate to replace our fallen comrade who has gone onto pastures new. Not so fun facts:-	Move in date is June 7th-	Room is £600, excluding bills (bills come to about £75 per month)-	The room is a downstairs double, with a triple wardrobe, drawers and space for a desk -	The house comes with a kitchen/dining space, two bathrooms, large garden, as well as the usual amenities (dishwasher and Top Trumps included!)- 10 minute walk from both the Northern line, Victoria line and Overground - No issues with WFH, but unfortunately no room to set up shop in communal spaces Fun facts: We're ordinary folks at heart, LGBTQ friendly, we keep a tidy ship, converse on subjects we know nothing about and like a bit of a party etc etc. Ideally, weâd like a yes (wo)man (between 25-29) as the final piece of the puzzle. We like the idea of pooling our friendship groups to keep things interesting. Weekdays would be more chill, cooking together or pub vibe. Then weekends are nights out, pres/posts at ours and the occasional house party.Willy - 27, standard corp job, wannabe alpha but will settle for a lot less.Sarah - 27, attempting to tame these curls and the smell of incense by managing a therapy service and mentoring.  Sam - 27, English tutor/writing postgrad at Central, does his best work in colourful dungarees. Emily â 28, mental health nurse carrying the burden of the NHS in a tiny lil handbag. Bonus points if you can correctly guess each persons room!If nothing else, remember:âA house is made of bricks and beams. A home is made of hopes and dreams.â","Flat

2023-04-17,Looking for a flatmate,£750 pcm,"Hello there,Thanks for reading - please read through and get in touch if you think the place might suit.I have a single room to rent (for single occupancy)in a two bed flat - as my flatmate is moving to Wales! The length of the tenancy is yearly. Short lets not considered as I hope to find someone who would commit to a decent length of time.The flat is situated between London fields and Victoria park - in a great area in east London. Its pretty quiet but also near parks, Lido, cafes, bakeries etc. And well connected for public transport.The room is peaceful and in a friendly neighbourhood.Though its a single room there is a little space in other parts of the house to store some stuff (so its not like you have to cram everything into one room)There is a shared kitchen, bathroom and living room too. The living room is not pictured Iâm trying to give it change around - it could be used as a shared work/relax space - its a work in progress.Also an outside mezzanine. Iâm listing it as unfurnished but there may be a some furniture to buy depending on my flatmates plans.Iâm an artist also working part/time in childcare - Iâm about to begin an p/t art therapy ma. I work a little from home and also spend some time at my sonâs (i coparent) Iâm originally from the west of Ireland but have lived in Hackney for many years having been involved in food and the arts here also.Iâm in my mid 50âs. My interests are music, art, reading, yoga, meditation, food. Iâm friendly, thoughtful, sensitive with a sense of humour. Like a chat and happy with my own company too.Iâm pretty busy and self motivated but happy to share a cuppa or some food at times.I eat pretty healthily, mostly vegetarian. And keen on recycling and environmental matters.I like to keep the flat tidy and try and put as much love into the space as possible.I would prefer someone who doesnât work from home  as I donât think working too much from home is good for anybody.I think the arrangement would suit someone a little older (+35) Someone respectful, consideratesomeone who would like to consider it a shared home and therefore happy to put a little effort into  a shared space.

I would prefer a flatmate who does not have lots of people over regularly or party lots.I tend to be out and about evenings and weekends and work from the office about 3x a week so when Iâm at home, I tend to keep to myself, so youâll have a lot of time and space to yourself.No couples or pets please!THE RENT£850 per month, including bills (includes gas, electricity, water, TV licence, broadband, council tax and various streaming services via Smart TV)Thanks,Jumi",Flat share,Peckham,SE15,https://www.spareroom.co.uk/flatshare/flatshare_detail.pl?flatshare_id=16087308&search_id=1212446191&city_id=&flatshare_type=offered&search_results=%2Fflatshare%2F%3Foffset%3D420%26search_id%3D1212446191%26sort_by%3Dby_day%26mode%3Dlist&,21 May 2023,3 months,None,Furnished,Yes,,,,,shared,Yes,No,No,No,Professional,,26,Males or females,34,,Spareroom

Just under 1,000 sqft so quite roomy which is nice.A bit about me....Iâm 29 (mere moments away from 30), love running, reading, cooking, tennis, trying new restaurants and I think most of the normal stuff (food, drink, friends, holidays)! I work in property for a family fund in West London, mainly buying hotels. Not the most exciting and probably not what I dreamt about being as a child but it pays the bills. Iâm in the office twice a week (typically Monday & Wednesday) and then WFH the other 3 days. Iâm exceptionally clean and tidy and actually enjoy cleaning - I love being in a nice space and value having that âpeacefulâ feeling at home. Iâm chatty, friendly and generally a pretty happy, easy-going person. Iâm half British/Australian, lived in East London for 6 years and am doing the big move to South London!Coming with the house is my gorgeous best friend Roo ð¶. Sheâs nearly 3, short haired red and white border collie and totally house trained and well behaved. She's also really clean as she's short haired and loves people and attention. She basically comes everywhere with me and weâre always out on walks. She doesn't bark :) It's really important to me that you love dogs - you'll of course have no responsibility with her but she does love a lot of love so I want her to have that. I think she suffers from a bit of anxiety - typical Londoner.I have found this house and am viewing it tomorrow (Saturday 15th) and hoping to secure it ASAP. I am wanting to get someone to sign the lease with me or I am open to couples but only one of you can be on the lease (no HMO licence) and I'd be looking for a bit more money. There is a spare bedroom that I'm thinking of putting an extra wardrobe in and turning it into an office that we can both use.You will need to provide previous rental references and be in full-time employment.Move in is mid-June as the landlord is going to repaint and freshen the place up. I want to make the house a home and although I'm independent it would be great to live with someone that will become a friend - I'm all for hosting the occasional dinner party/BBQ/drinks also!!Thanks for reading this long and winding tale...if you are interested can you please get back to me on the below?- Can you move-in on or before May 1st?- Are you able to sign a lease in the next week and leave a 5 week deposit? (£1,565)- Do you love dogs?!- Could you potentially come and view with me tomorrow 15th April at 10.45am?Look forward to hearing from you - please also feel free to whatsapp if easier!Jess & Roo",House share,Herne Hill,SE24,https://www.spareroom.co.uk/flatshare/flatshare_detail.pl?flatshare_id=16672497&search_id=1212446191&city_id=&flatshare_type=offered&search_results=%2Fflatshare%2F%3Foffset%3D510%26search_id%3D1212446191%26sort_by%3Dby_day%26mode%3Dlist&featured=1&listing_click=1,Now,12 months,None,Unfurnished,Yes,Yes,Yes,,,shared,No,Yes,No,No,Professional,Yes,,Males or females,,,Spareroom

I work from home most days, but its looking like my job might be trying to trick get me into coming back to office / I often work from the (beautiful) cafe in front of the flat.

Down to chill, chat, split a drink together, but also able to give space to recharge / live their own life. My hobbies include;  going to the gym, travelling, attempting to speak Spanish (semi-fluent), and fitnessy stuff like climbing, muay thai, and BJJ.

We enjoy cooking, listening to music, drinking wine and watching good shows, and tending to our new veg patch in the garden.We are looking for someone who is chilled and friendly, who has their own social life but is up for joining us for a chat and a glass of wine.

We want to do this over the summer as we plan to be away quite a bit. We advertise this as a 3 month let as this is all we could commit to at this stage- but we are open to dicsussing extending the arrangement for longer if after living together we all feel that it is working well for both sides.The Room: The room is a bright, mid-sized double with direct garden access.

Our ideal housemate: We would love to be joined by a person who is friendly, tidy and respectful of our shared space. Ideally, our new housemate is working in an office rather than WFH. We plan to be away for 3-4 weeks over the summer, so the person would enjoy quite a few spells of having the whole property to themselves. We would just ask that our housemate could feed our cat Uno and water the garden during the spells that we are away, if they plan to be at home during those weeks (10-17 June, 7-14 July), in exchange for the benefit of having the whole property to themselves. If you could let us know when enuiring if you are free during those dates it would help, as it would be a bonus for us to find a housemate that is home those weeks and we would want to give first dibs to those applicants.

2023-04-17,Beautiful flat near viccy park,£975 pcm,"Sadly, Iâm leaving London and have to give up my spot in this lovely flat with my amazing flatmate. Iâm looking for someone special to fill the room in our 2 bedroom flat commencing 7th May.Weâve lived here since September 2020 and have loved every moment. Weâve enjoyed the very strong community vibe, the lazy strolls to Victoria Park and easy access to all the best spots the East has to offer. There are also 3 pubs and 3 bakeries on our street â life is good here.The apartment is filled with light, is spacious, has lots of storage and has an outdoor patio which is heavenly for getting some rays in before the day starts. The room available is on the top floor at the back of the apartment. Itâs quiet and offers pretty sunrises each morning. There are two built in floor-to-ceiling wardrobes, with room for double bed + bedside and mirror. Thereâs also a shelf for plants, books and bits â double glazed windows were recently installed too. Just outside the room, thereâs a space for large drawers for your exclusive use. Some furniture can be included for a one-off fee or you can bring your own. Living spaces are all shared and easy to keep tidy. Weâre a very clean flat. Looks better, feels better! Ideally, you are a hybrid or in-office worker to keep things balanced. If and when you work from home, the dining room table is a good shout, alternatively there are lots of cafes to work from too. The 425 and 277 towards Mile End tube depart at the bus stop out the front, the other direction will get you Hackney / Dalston way. The 377 toward Liverpool Street / London Bridge leaves just around the corner. The canal and Mare Street are about a 15 min walk, London Fields is around 20. Choose from The Hemmingway, Lauriston, Empress or Royal Inn as your new boozer. The big Tesco on Well St (right by The Gun) is about 15 min walk, or you can grab some lovely bits from the organic grocer just out front. Thereâs a Pure Gym a 10 min walk away or you can join in on some group fitness action in the park if thatâs your thing. A little about my lovely flatmate Katy. Sheâs Australian, 34, work in fashion and has lived in London for four character-building years. Sheâs  into the arts, good music, and dogs (she doesnât have one, but is partial to babysitting / waving at them from the window). She loves buying plants, afternoons at the pub and dyeing and experimenting with fabrics. Sheâs an active gal and likes to keep local on the weekends. She often travels for work, too. Iâm looking for someone who is of similar interests, is respectful of the space and likes to keep things both chilled and sacred whilst also being up for a pint and a laugh every so often. Pescatarian / vegetarian folks and a love of raising plants will earn extra points!The area itself is quite sleepy and we try to be respectful of one another. So no afters, sorry :) Long brunches, lunches and dinners are of course welcomed.The cost of the room is £975 paid directly to our very lovely landlord on the 1st of each month. Youâll take on 50% of the lease, bills are shared equally which is roughly £100 pp p/m (council tax, internet, gas/electricity etc). Lastly, weâre a LGBTQI+ welcoming household and embrace racial diversity. Itâs important that you share these values too.",Flat share,Hackney,E9,https://www.spareroom.co.uk/flatshare/flatshare_detail.pl?flatshare_id=16674492&search_id=1212446191&city_id=&flatshare_type=offered&search_results=%2Fflatshare%2F%3Foffset%3D660%26search_id%3D1212446191%26sort_by%3Dby_day%26mode%3Dlist&,07 May 2023,6 months,None,Furnished,,,Yes,Yes,,shared,Yes,No,Yes,No,Professional,,25,Males or females,,Yes,Spareroom

The huge communal space is perfect for relaxing and cooking with a large dining room table along with full gas hobs and lots of kitchen storage, fridge freezer, Fan Oven, Kettle, Toaster, Microwave, Dishwasher and Washing Machine. There is also a large utility cupboard for storing all suitcases or bags. This also includes the private garden for you to enjoy. It is also HMO registered and managed by Taylor Gibbs Estate Agent. You can also buy a parking permit for the street (it cost me £32 for the year but will vary depending on your car's CO2 emission band)*The Area*Located 10/15 minutes from both Archway and Highgate underground stations with a very convenient bus stop 2 minutes from the flat with buses into Central LDN, the flat is very well connected. You are also a 10 minute walk from the lovely Highgate village with plenty of bars, cafes and amenities (Sainsbury's Local and Co-Op 5mins walk away). The street is very quiet and the room has no street noise at all. *Bills*Rent is £1,150 per calendar month excluding other bills and is due on the 22nd of every month. Bills (Council Tax - Haringey BAND F, Gas, Electric, Water, Broadband) in total come to about £150 per month. Given you are replacing me, you will pay the deposit of £1163.45 to me and then take over my existing deposit of the same amount with Taylor Gibbs (company who manage the property). There is also a £25 fee for both myself and you to pay each change the name on the contract. *Contract terms*The contract is 24 months (ending on Oct 21st 2024), with a minimum break clause term of 14 months requiring at least 2 months notice. This means the earliest you may activate the break clause for the tenancy is in 7.5 months time ie to leave on Dec 21st 2023. However, you are also allowed to leave the tenancy at any time as long as you can find a replacement tenant, although for my flatmates a 6-month minimum term would be preferred.MOVE-IN DATEI am looking to rent out the room from Saturday 6th May onwards. As rent is due from the 22nd of each month, you will need to pay me 2 weeks rent and then subsequently you can pay monthly from the 22nd of each month as standard.----*NEXT STEPS*If possible please could you fill out some questions? As you can imagine, the rental market is a bit hectic at the moment so just helps me find out if youâre a good fit for the flat:Tell me a bit about yourself! What do you do for work? What are your interests and hobbies?Whatâs are your work hours?How long would you be looking to stay in the flat?Whatâs your salary? (helps me understand your ability to afford the rent)If you have any questions for me, donât hesitate to ask!Look forward to hearing from you.Thanks,Cheran",Flat share,Highgate,N6,https://www.spareroom.co.uk/flatshare/flatshare_detail.pl?flatshare_id=16665488&search_id=1212446191&city_id=&flatshare_type=offered&search_results=%2Fflatshare%2F%3Foffset%3D890%26search_id%3D1212446191%26sort_by%3Dby_day%26mode%3Dlist&,06 May 2023,6 months,18 months,Furnished,No,No,Yes,Yes,No,shared,No,No,Yes,No,Professional,Yes,22,Male preferred,30,,Spareroom
