Female only, sorry no students and no couples.The bathroom will usually only be shared between yourself and one other, there is also a separate WC upstairs. We have a weekly cleaner and I also keep all the toilet rolls, kitchen rolls, washing up liquid, bin bags, hand soaps, cleaning products, air fresheners etc stocked at no extra cost- so gone are the days of arguing over who buys the toilet rolls!

We are a young couple looking for a lodger in our lovely two-bed apartment in Wandsworth.The flat is in a quiet and safe area, and an 8 min walk from Wandsworth Town station and 12 min walk from Clapham Junction and Northcote Rd. The bedroom comes furnished as photographed and has a tiny balcony accessible through your bedroom door that you will have sole use of. Beautiful sunset views! The dressing table can go if youÃ¢ÂÂd like to have a proper desk. You will share a bathroom with Matt and I. There is a fantastic kitchen kitted with a gas hob, dishwasher, washing machine and tumble dryer. The lounge has a giant TV and a sleeper couch which we often use for guests. I am 30, South African, and I work as a nanny in the area. Matt is 25 and heralds from Edinburgh.

We enjoy having people over, but equally relish vegetating with a glass of wine in front of the TV. We are looking for someone who is easy going, clean and respectful.

ItÃ¢ÂÂs ideal for someone who likes a clean & tidy space and takes pride in maintaining their environment. I pay a housekeeper to visit every week to make our lives easier. SheÃ¢ÂÂs a key member of the household and we respect her highly! ItÃ¢ÂÂll be possible to pay her for ironing or other similar services if required. Smoking is permitted on the balconies, although we try to keep this to a minimum. If youÃ¢ÂÂre a heavy tobacco smoker you may be asked to take it outside the apartment. The neighbours are kind and respectful, and I maintain a great relationship with them. BEDROOMSBedroom 1 NOT CURRENTLY AVAILABLEThis is my personal bedroom, available intermittently for short periods while I travel. ItÃ¢ÂÂs a luxurious space to relax in! My belongings will remain there while IÃ¢ÂÂm away. Women only, no couples. The room has a super-kingsize bed with orthopaedic mattress. It has blackout blinds and linen curtains that let beautiful light through in the mornings whilst maintaining privacy. I've added a number of cool features including some incredible mood lighting to make the room a magical and relaxing space.Bedroom 2:NOT CURRENTLY AVAILABLEThis room includes a desk, deep wardrobe with drawers, and a bedside table. The comfy double bed has an orthopaedic mattress and lifts up to reveal plenty more storage. The room also has blackout blinds. There's a large balcony adjacent, which is available for you to rent privately if you wish, giving you an entire ""wing"" of the flat to yourself. Price on request. Bedroom 3 AVAILABLE - flexible datesThis room offers a small wardrobe, a large amount of storage under the double bed, and the same high quality mattress and blackout blinds as in the other bedrooms. If you have a lot of belongings or need to work from home, this room wonÃ¢ÂÂt be suitable for you.BathroomThere is one large shared bathroom, and I can offer you a shelf in the cupboard for storage.

Marks and Sparks is also a short cycle away. For street food, London's famous Borough Market and Maltby Street Market are nearby, and St James Market (a local secret!) is even closer. We have plenty of restaurants and shops around, and lots of options on Deliveroo and UberEats. OUTDOOR SPACESRoof terrace with sunrise views of Canary WharfGarden2x balconies in flatSouthwark's largest park, Burgess Park, is a 5min walk away, and Southwark Park itself is an 18min walk. There are also a number of smaller green spaces nearby. PARKINGThere's a gated car park with high security indoor bicycle and motorcycle storage behind a coded door under CCTV. There may be a car parking space available for hire from one of our neighbours on request, but I can't guarantee this. WORKING FROM HOMEThere's high speed broadband, great mobile signal, and we get fantastic natural lighting during the day - perfect for video calls and filming.Bedroom 3 is not available for those who need to work from home. PEOPLEIÃ¢ÂÂm a Life Coach and Personal Trainer of 12 years, and also run a dog training business amongst other things. There may be the opportunity to work out together, enjoy the presence of animals, and engage in an atmosphere of personal growth and healing. I cook delicious healthy food, and love to share that with others. From time to time I may offer you a meal. WeÃ¢ÂÂre open-minded & non-judgemental in our attitudes, and definitely not opposed to recreational alcohol consumption etc. When family & children visit the property itÃ¢ÂÂs important we keep things PG. I would prefer if you didnÃ¢ÂÂt bring guests into my home, but trusted guests may be welcome on request and within reasonable limits. It wonÃ¢ÂÂt be possible to bring back people you just met eg on a night out. Safety and security are paramount. Communication is key and we nurture a culture of respect and non-judgement. This household is LGBQT+ friendly, anti-sexist and anti-racist. LIFESTYLEThere are a lot of perks to living here, and the guideline is to leave the space as you found it. We donÃ¢ÂÂt need perfection, and you wonÃ¢ÂÂt be subject to any unrealistic expectations. As a dancer, you might find me playing music or practising choreography. I use the main space for client calls and online PT sessions a few times a week. From time to time I rent out my personal room for short periods while IÃ¢ÂÂm away to help pay for my travel, and my housekeeper manages things while I'm away. Home is a place to recharge, and 90% of the time things are extremely peaceful here. Other times we board dogs, host dinner parties, and do fun activities. I personally prefer a mix of intellectually stimulating conversation and plenty of alone time to decompress from the social nature of my work. If this sounds like a good fit, I'd love to hear from you! Kindly note that weÃ¢ÂÂll need to have a phone call before viewing. Warm regards,MelodyBONUS SECTIONThank you for reading this far! Please see below for a description of the *ideal* applicant, who will receive priority consideration. For you, I would be over the moon to be flexible on age, gender, and employment criteria. The ideal person would be able to not just maintain good standards of cleanliness, but take an active role in the household.They would be established in their business or career, come with a professional and personal network to complement mine, and be in a position to reciprocate the benefits that come from living with a PT, Nutritionist, Wellness and Life Coach with 12 years of business and entrepreneurship experience. The ideal flatmate would have a great skill set with dogs, including how to treat them with respect. They would make it possible for me to have a dog of my own, which - alongside enjoying a professionally trained dog - would include supporting in the training and care of the animal.The ideal applicant understands that we are culturalised into misogyny, racism, homophobia etc. and would be working on their own beliefs and behaviours to avoid bringing this home. From a selfish standpoint, misogyny is particularly problematic for me.I deeply appreciate people with excellent communication skills, eg those who are able to set & receive healthy boundaries with kindness and grace. I love intellectual, philosophical & thoughtful convo, and don't really engage in gossip or celeb culture. Most of the time I prefer to be introverted at home due to the social nature of my work and the emotional loads to decompress from. You don't need to be like me at all (we love diversity), but a personality type to complement this would be ideal. These are not necessities, simply the *ideal*, and the only things it will be possible to flex on my basic age, gender and employment criteria for.

143,1739,2023-04-17,Beautiful flat near viccy park,Â£975 pcm,"Sadly, IÃ¢ÂÂm leaving London and have to give up my spot in this lovely flat with my amazing flatmate. IÃ¢ÂÂm looking for someone special to fill the room in our 2 bedroom flat commencing 7th May.WeÃ¢ÂÂve lived here since September 2020 and have loved every moment. WeÃ¢ÂÂve enjoyed the very strong community vibe, the lazy strolls to Victoria Park and easy access to all the best spots the East has to offer. There are also 3 pubs and 3 bakeries on our street Ã¢ÂÂ life is good here.The apartment is filled with light, is spacious, has lots of storage and has an outdoor patio which is heavenly for getting some rays in before the day starts. The room available is on the top floor at the back of the apartment. ItÃ¢ÂÂs quiet and offers pretty sunrises each morning. There are two built in floor-to-ceiling wardrobes, with room for double bed + bedside and mirror. ThereÃ¢ÂÂs also a shelf for plants, books and bits Ã¢ÂÂ double glazed windows were recently installed too. Just outside the room, thereÃ¢ÂÂs a space for large drawers for your exclusive use. Some furniture can be included for a one-off fee or you can bring your own. Living spaces are all shared and easy to keep tidy. WeÃ¢ÂÂre a very clean flat. Looks better, feels better! Ideally, you are a hybrid or in-office worker to keep things balanced. If and when you work from home, the dining room table is a good shout, alternatively there are lots of cafes to work from too. The 425 and 277 towards Mile End tube depart at the bus stop out the front, the other direction will get you Hackney / Dalston way. The 377 toward Liverpool Street / London Bridge leaves just around the corner. The canal and Mare Street are about a 15 min walk, London Fields is around 20. Choose from The Hemmingway, Lauriston, Empress or Royal Inn as your new boozer. The big Tesco on Well St (right by The Gun) is about 15 min walk, or you can grab some lovely bits from the organic grocer just out front. ThereÃ¢ÂÂs a Pure Gym a 10 min walk away or you can join in on some group fitness action in the park if thatÃ¢ÂÂs your thing. A little about my lovely flatmate Katy. SheÃ¢ÂÂs Australian, 34, work in fashion and has lived in London for four character-building years. SheÃ¢ÂÂs  into the arts, good music, and dogs (she doesnÃ¢ÂÂt have one, but is partial to babysitting / waving at them from the window). She loves buying plants, afternoons at the pub and dyeing and experimenting with fabrics. SheÃ¢ÂÂs an active gal and likes to keep local on the weekends. She often travels for work, too. IÃ¢ÂÂm looking for someone who is of similar interests, is respectful of the space and likes to keep things both chilled and sacred whilst also being up for a pint and a laugh every so often. Pescatarian / vegetarian folks and a love of raising plants will earn extra points!The area itself is quite sleepy and we try to be respectful of one another. So no afters, sorry :) Long brunches, lunches and dinners are of course welcomed.The cost of the room is Â£975 paid directly to our very lovely landlord on the 1st of each month. YouÃ¢ÂÂll take on 50% of the lease, bills are shared equally which is roughly Â£100 pp p/m (council tax, internet, gas/electricity etc). Lastly, weÃ¢ÂÂre a LGBTQI+ welcoming household and embrace racial diversity.
